The second part of his description could be interpreted as a large earthquake and tsunami following/accompanying the eruption, as a result of which ""the land was heaved up several feet and then suddenly went down fathoms deep beneath the sea, engulfing every living thing from the coast line back to Scinde Island, Mohaka and Te Wairoa, and Scinde Island, Parke Island and a few other small islets near Petone alone remained. The sea rolled over all the drowned plains and valleys, and when the mighty volcanoes had spent their force, and the skies cleared, there was nothing to be seen but broken canoes, parts of dwellings, and some of the bodies of the ill-fated inhabitants. The outer fringe of the coast went down the farthest, and the inner edge but a few feet.""
At the time Lambert wrote this, the area around Napier was 2-3 m lower than today (having been raised in the 1931 earthquake). The basis of Lambert's story is uncertain as it is not referenced. According to Eiby (1968) and also hinted at in the rest of Lambert's account (see the full transcription), it may be an elaborate reconstruction in support of the author’s theory that Ahuriri lagoon was once a vast plain.
However, it is known from micropaleontological evidence collected in Ahuriri lagoon that the 1931 earthquake is the only identifiable major earthquake-related uplift event in the last 7200 cal years and that the long-term movement of the area is down (Hayward et al 2006). The latest major earthquake-related subsidence event (ca 1 m) occurred in ~600 BP (Hayward et al 2006), that is, within the Maori historical record. Such an event could possibly be a plate interface event, and as such, could cause a tsunami. Lambert's story is, however, highly dramatic, and suspect until confirmed by another more reliable Maori oral history record, or by geological evidence of a major earthquake and coseismic tsunami, and for this reason a validity of 1 is assigned.","In the chapters on early East Coast Maori history, Lambert (1925) records the following: ""A terrific rumbling and roaring, as of a thousand mighty cataracts falling over high precipices was heard inland. The earth began to rock, the great plain presenting the appearance of undulating sea waves. Then Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe, Tongariro and perhaps Waikaremoana (19) belched forth what is commonly called fire and smoke, but in reality steam from superheated water, and the reflection of gigantic masses of red hot rock hurled out. Lightning flashed over a wide extent of the heavens, and the thunder seemed to rival the roaring of the volcanoes. The great black clouds, charged with pestilential vapours, spread far and wide, and driven by a fierce gale they soon quite obscured the sun. All this time the earth continued to rock laterally, and then a tremendous upward explosion occurred, as though the final cataclysm had come. The land was heaved up several feet and then suddenly went down fathoms deep beneath the sea, engulfing every living thing from the coast line back to Scinde Island, Mohaka and Te Wairoa, and Scinde Island, Parke Island and a few other small islets near Petone alone remained.

King et al. (2007), in their paper entitled “Māori Environmental Knowledge and natural hazards in Aotearoa-New Zealand” suggest that, “it is likely that these events were recorded to give explanation to the causes of natural hazards, to record loss of life, and serve as warnings about the nature of particular places”. Often there are several versions of one event.
A number of stories relating to a similar era and involving the destruction of people and/or boats by great waves relate to the southern coasts of Southland. For example: “There is spot below the sea-cliffs at Orepuki … called Kaitakata [now, Kaitangata]… and this is so called not because of man-eating man, but because the sea there rose in its might and devoured some people in its capacious maw. A large party of Te-Mano-o-te-Rapuwai [i.e. Rapuawai people] were travelling along the beach from the Waiau river when a great wave (Tai-koko) swept them away …” (Beattie, 1915). This story/tradition is perhaps the one for this era that most suggests a tsunami. As far as dating the event, Stack (1877) estimates that the Waitaha occupied the Southern part of NZ from mid-15th (approx. 1477) to mid-16th century, and that the Rapuwai were a pre-Waitaha people. The story is remarkably similar to another event supposedly in the 1820s (q.v.).
Other stories of the early Maori era relate to an event, perhaps separate and earlier, in which large waves in some way affect the Takitimu canoe, in which traditionally the Maori reached Southland. In one of these stories, the Taki-timu canoe “stuck fast on a sand bank, and the united efforts of all of the crew could not get her off. When Tamatea found himself in this plight he became very angry, and cried out to Rua-wharo, “What do you mean by this, have you brought me here to drown me?” Rua-wharo also grew angry, and standing up he called to the sea to rise to his help. Immediately a great tidal wave came to his assistance; the canoe was lifted right into the river, where they all held her fast, while the scour back of the great wave made that river the deepest in Aotea-roa. There the Taki-tumu went ashore.” (Downes, 1914).
Although the two stories cited above could represent real, possibly separate, tsunami events and their existence needs to be acknowledged, it is appropriate to assign a validity of 2 (questionable), until such time as these events can be corroborated by paleotsunami or other studies.","See ""Tsunami impact/sea level disturbance in New Zealand summary"" column.",,Not listed.,"Beattie, H. 1915b.

King et al. suggest that, “it is likely that these events were recorded to give explanation to the causes of natural hazards, to record loss of life, and serve as warnings about the nature of particular places”.
One such is the story relating to the destruction, in about the 14th century, of a place called Taporapora located near the Kaipara Harbour. According to one version of the story/tradition, “that place (Taporapora) was shaved off (taraia noatia) by the sea, and the land disappeared together with the Whare-kura, the atuas (gods) and the tikis (images)—all were carried away by the sea.” (Smith, 1897).
King et al. (2007) give several other versions of the story from Parnell (2004), which suggest storm, storm surge or both, or indeed a meteorite. They conclude, however, that “A tsunami can not be entirely ruled out.”

(2007), “Māori oral accounts of earthquakes are rare in written records, with only a handful of stories recounting the physical and social impacts from earth movements.
Perhaps the most well known oral tradition is that concerning the Hao-whenua earthquake. This is recorded by the Ngāti Ira iwi from the Wellington Harbour region. The Hao-whenua earthquake caused the land around the Rongotai Isthmus to be uplifted, drying up the narrow stream channel called Te-Awa-a-Taia and joining Miramar Peninsula to the mainland coast. According to Best (1918), this took place in about the mid 15th century AD, around 18 generations before he was writing. Geological evidence indicates that the channel was most probably open during the time of early Māori occupation, but that it suddenly closed off sometime during the same period (Pillans & Huber 1995; Goff 1997). The channel is also named in the oral traditions of the Ngāti Tara iwi, who lived in the Wellington Harbour region prior to Ngāti Ira (Best 1923) and was clearly a marked feature of the area prior to uplift.
The name Hao-whenua was interpreted as meaning the destroying or swallowing up of the land, which is at odds with the general nature of the event, an uplift, and caused Best (1918) to treat the tradition with some scepticism. It is possible though that the name does not necessarily refer to the earthquake per se, but rather to a tsunami generated by it. The associated inundation could be perceived as destroying or swallowing up the land, although a more applicable translation of Hao-whenua states that it could mean “to sweep the land clean” (Goff et al. 2003, p. 796).”
Although such an event is not unlikely, a validity of 2 (questionable) seems appropriate, until such time as more conclusive geological evidence of the tsunami is found.","See ""Tsunami impact/sea level disturbance in New Zealand summary"" column.",,Not listed.,"King, D.

For example, the Coming of the Sands is perhaps one of the most compelling traditions from the Taranaki region (Smith 1910) [transcribed below]. The tradition refers to a place called Potiki-taua between Waitaha and Tipoko, just to the south of Cape Taranaki. It was here that Potiki-roa and his party settled. Mango-huruhuru, the old priest, built a large house on low land near the sea; Potiki-roa and his wife lived in a house on higher ground a bit further inland. The old priest’s house was fronted by a rocky beach which was a poor landing place for canoes. Mango-huruhuru decided to use his powers to improve matters and to bring some sand from Hawaiki. After sunset he climbed on his roof and sang his karakia. As soon as he had finished, a large storm hit, bringing much sand with it. Many people, including the old priest and his daughter, were buried in the sand. Houses, cultivations, and all the surrounding land were covered in a deep layer of sand, but Potiki-roa and his wife escaped because they had built their home further inland and uphill. According to Smith’s (1910) calculations this occurred in the 16th century. ...T he Coming of the Sand is associated with lightning and high winds and is a vivid description of a large storm. However, the water penetrates a long way inland, far enough to cover the whole area including all the cultivations in a thick layer of sand.

However, the search was not comprehensive.",,"“According to Māori tradition, 1820 or thereabouts, was a year of great disturbances, earthquakes in the north and tidal waves in the south … the Maories of Murihiku, both on the west and south-east coasts affirm that a great tidal wave swept over the area where Orepuki now is, and all along the western coast, and thereby many hundreds of the Ngati Mamoe tribe met their deaths by drowning. It appears that it was the usual custom for tribes to meet together at the Waiau mouth in the autumn to provide themselves with enough fish to carry them over the long winter…. They were travelling along the beach track when great tidal waves rose from the ocean, and carried them out to sea, and it is believed no survivors remained to tell the story; a similar adventure is also recorded from an area beyond Fortrose.” (Southland Daily News ca. 1936)
The above account is the most informative of the several similar accounts, particularly in its reference to earthquakes in the north, the time of year (autumn), the number of Māori drowned, and to the extent of the event. The dates of the various accounts, whose original source is unknown, differ, but all are within the first three decades of the 19th century. The other accounts also suggest similar effects may have occurred along other parts of the coast although it is not clear that this was at the same time. The descriptions are consistent with a tsunami rather than storm. However, the stories do have some similarities with a relatively well-established storm event in June 1823, in which 40 or so Māori, including the chief, were drowned when their canoe foundered at sea during a storm on a food-gathering trip to Ruapuke Island, in Foveaux Strait. (Extracted and abridged from Downes et al. (2005))
Although written records of the sealers and whalers, the only Europeans in Southland in this era, have been extensively investigated by historians, as far as is known no accounts of the possible tsunami event in the early 1800s have been found among them. However, accounts of possible tsunami relating to a much earlier period of Māori settlement around 1200-1600 (see event for this date) have been found. While several of these stories are mythical, and others could relate to flooding in storms, one has strong similarities to the 1820s tsunami story, casting doubt on the reliability of the 1800s date. It is possible that 19-20th century oral historians have associated the story with the wrong period. (Extracted and abridged from Downes et al. (2005))
If the tsunami was real and affected the locations mentioned, a minimum of 80-100 km of Southland’s southern coast was involved. Because the beach at Orepuki runs along the base of cliffs (which are known to have retreated in the last 150 years), only a moderate tsunami, perhaps 2-4 m high, would be needed to cause the deaths of those walking along the beach.
While the account quoted above makes reference to earthquakes in the “north”, there is no suggestion in any account that the Southland Māori felt an earthquake immediately prior to the tsunami. Few pre-European settlement (i.e. pre-1840) earthquakes have been identified, let alone well-located, the exception being a large earthquake (M7.5+) in 1826 that has been located to the Fiordland west coast by Downes et al. (2005). Downes et al. show that this event was not capable of causing more than a small tsunami in Southland. Other potential sources of the tsunami are a large subduction interface Puysegur Trench earthquake or possibly a large South American event. The former has been shown by Downes et al (2005) to be capable of sending a moderate tsunami onto Southland’s coast. However, a South American tsunami would need to be larger than those experienced in Southland in 1868, 1877 and 1960 (q.v.), and larger than the South American events known to have occurred in the period 1800-1840.
Although the stories could represent a real tsunami event, it is appropriate to assign a validity of 2 (questionable), until such time as other more authoritative accounts can be found or events can be verified by paleotsunami studies.","Added to the terrible war was the great catastrophe of the great tidal wave which overwhelmed the whole tribe while they were travelling on the beach from Colac to Waiau Beach. It was at Kaitangata Point that this tragedy occurred. (Saunders, 1934); According to Maori tradition, 1820 or thereabouts, was a year of great disturbances, earthquakes in the north and tidal waves in the south … the Maories of Murihiku, both on the west and south-east coasts affirm that a great tidal wave swept over the area where Orepuki now is, and all along the western coast, and thereby many hundreds of the Ngati Mamoe tribe met their deaths by drowning. It appears that it was the usual custom for tribes to meet together at the Waiau mouth in the autumn to provide themselves with enough fish to carry them over the long winter…. They were traveling along the beach track when great tidal waves rose from the ocean, and carried them out to sea, and it is believed no survivors remained to tell the story; a similar adventure is also recorded from an area beyond Fortrose. (Saunders, 1936); About 1811, a large party from Pahi's village and Colac Bay were making their way westward to gather food for the winter, when they were overwhelmed by a huge tidal wave which dashed them all against Kaitangata's cliff. Not one of them survived this disaster, and this incident took its toll on the Maori population of the area. Incidentally Kaitangata today, situated just west of Monkey island, is much diminished to what it was then, having been washed by many tides over the years since it is now hardly noticeable as a feature on the beach. (Smith, 2003); Pahia was originally a Maori pa. In the early days it was at Otatara, Colac and Pahia or the Aropaki district that the natives of the western district congregated. In and around Pahia are many evidences of the old days when a powerful Maori race lived in this district. Farmers when ploughing, found battle axes and skulls and greenstone weapons, and it must have been a period just before the landing of the whalers and sealers that the great war between the northern and southern Maories, which almost exterminated the powerful tribe, took place. Following this terrible war was the catastrophe of the great tidal wave which overwhelmed the whole tribe while they were travelling along the beach from Orepuki to the Waiau Beach. It was at Kaitangata Point that this tragedy occurred. The place is most suitably named for Kaitangata in Maori means ‘eat a tribe’. (Reece, 1984); In “Saga of the Pioneers” a story describing Otara as “quite historical for it was on the Otara beach that there was a large Māori pa which was attacked by the northern Māoris. While they were indulging in a great cannibal feast, a huge tidal wave came up from the sea and swept everything within radius away After the great storm which plainly showed the anger of the Great Spirit, the beach lay bare and all the looted treasures of greenstone, battle axes and ornaments were covered with sand washed up by the seas. Many of the Māories were engulphed and lost their lives. It was a strange fact that at this same period at the beginning of last century (1800s) this great tidal wave also swept over the Orepuki beach and a large party of Māories who were journeying to the Waiau mouth to obtain food for the winter were exterminated.” (McIntosh, 1985)",,Listed in Fraser (1998).

At times he [a person formerly engaged in sealing in Dusky Bay] and his party, who then resided on a small island, were so alarmed lest it should be submerged, that they put out to sea; there, however, they found no safety, for such was the flux and reflux of the ocean, that they were in the greatest danger of being swamped, and were thankful to get on shore again. The sealers were accustomed to visit a small cove called the jail, which was a most suitable place for anchorage, being well sheltered with lofty cliffs on every side; and having deep water in it close to the shore , so that they could step out on to the rocks from their boats. It is situated about 80 miles [130 km] to the north of Dusky Bay. After the earthquakes the locality was so completely altered; the sea had so entirely retired from the cove, that it was dry land. Beyond Cascade Point the whole coast presented a most shattered appearance, so much so that its former state could scarcely be recognized. Large masses of the mountains had fallen, and in many places the trees might be seen, under water”. Taylor’s private journals (Taylor, ca. 1854) provide further information on the events as well as a roughly drawn map of the location of the sealers (Seal Islands in Dusky Sound) and of the location of the small cove they called the jail (a bay just inside Doubtful Sound, possibly the bay now known as Cascada Bay).
Taylor’s papers clearly describe a series of large earthquakes, at least one of which caused a significant tsunami, extensive landsliding and possible uplift, i.e. the described effects in the cove called the jail are consistent with uplift. Such uplift could have been caused by an earthquake on a nearby as-yet unrecognised fault in the upper plate, or on the plate interface. An earthquake on the predominantly right-lateral strike-slip offshore Alpine Fault would not be expected to cause uplift at Doubtful Sound, although several releasing bends and associated basins, where vertical deformation could occur, have been identified. The uplift, the apparent tsunami and extent of landsliding taken together suggests a plate interface event of large magnitude, M7.6 to possibly M8 (Downes et al. 2005). Note that the source area would encompass that of the 2003 August 22 MW7.2 Fiordland (plate interface) earthquake (q.v.).
Geological evidence of the earthquake and tsunami has been searched for at three sites on the Fiordland coast. At Cascada Bay near the mouth of Doubtful Sound, a series of raised bedrock platforms and recent revegetation of an 8 m high surface could be the result of tectonic uplift occurring in previous large earthquakes and vegetation stripping in a past tsunami. However further investigation of these features and confirmation of their age would be required before attributing them to the known historical events. Evidence of older earthquakes and/or tsunami appears to be preserved in sedimentary sequences at Martins Bay in northern Fiordland and at Goose Cove in southern Fiordland. Therefore, although the steep topography, high rainfall and strong wind and wave regime of Fiordland make it a challenging place for any evidence of past earthquakes and tsunami to be preserved, there is potential onshore to derive further information about behaviour of the offshore faults. (Downes et al. 2005)
Although the occurrence of the earthquake is probably real, the exact year is in doubt as a sealer’s diary of the era is available and mentions nothing of the event in 1826-27. Another account indicates a large earthquake was felt in 1833 on Stewart Island, and another possibly in southern Fiordland in about 1810-1820. Further discussion of historical and paleotsunami evidence for the earthquake and tsunami, credible earthquake sources models, and numerical tsunami propagation modelling is given in Downes et al. (2005).
Despite the uncertainties, the descriptions of the earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami are credible and occurrence of the tsunami is given a validity of 3.","In 1826 the greatest shocks were felt, they were sufficiently severe as to throw a man down. They continued five or six months to the beginning of 1827, seldom 2 days elapsed without one occurring. sometimes The narrator who was engaged in sealing there in Dusky Bay stated that some times they were so alarmed lest the island shd [should] sink that they used to push off to sea & there the flux and reflux of the sea was so violent that they were afraid of being swamped at sea & had to return again. [The narrator also stated] That there was a small cove which was shut in on every side with high land and thence named the Jail in which they were accustomed to anchor their sealboat as there was deep water in it and they could jump out of their boat on [to] the rocks. After these shocks, the sea completely retired from the cove so that it ceased to be any longer a harbour, as the boat could only come to its mouth. (Taylor, 1854); It appears that from 1826 to 1827 there was an almost constant succession of earthquakes, some of which were sufficiently violent to throw men down. At times he [a person formerly engaged in sealing in Dusky Bay] and his party, who then resided on a small island, were so alarmed lest it should be submerged, that they put out to sea; there, however, they found no safety, for such was the flux and reflux of the ocean, that they were in the greatest danger of being swamped, and were thankful to get on shore again. The sealers were accustomed to visit a small cove called the jail, which was a most suitable place for anchorage, being well sheltered with lofty cliffs on every side; and having deep water in it close to the shore , so that they could step out on to the rocks from their boats. It is situated about 80 miles to the north of Dusky Bay. After the earthquakes the locality was so completely altered; the sea had so entirely retired from the cove, that it was dry land. Beyond Cascade Point the whole coast presented a most shattered appearance, so much so that its former state could scarcely be recognized. Large masses of the mountains had fallen, and in many places the trees might be seen, under water. (Taylor, 1855)",,Not listed.,"Downes, G., Cochran, U., Wallace, L., Reyners, M., Berryman, K.

I had not proceeded far before I felt a powerful shock of the earthquake which nearly took me off my feet, rocking the trees to and fro and causing an immense swell in the sea. I knew perfectly well, from experience, that it was not an earthquake, but an electric shock caused by the eruption of a volcano or burning mountain, about 40 miles in the interior of the country; an occurrence not infrequent in those parts ..."".
Despite Burns associating the shock with an eruption, his account clearly describes an earthquake, with an intensity of at least MM6-MM7. His association of the earthquake with the “immense swell of the sea” suggests the two events occurred within short space of time, indicating a local source or seiching caused by surface waves from a more distant large (M>7.5) earthquake. However, seiching is unlikely to occur on the open coast, except within in a confined harbour or estuary, unlikely to be more than a metre and unlikely to initiate the comment “immense swell”. This suggests a local earthquake source within a short tsunami travel time (< 30 minutes), perhaps 50 km from Gisborne.
Given that ""tsunami earthquakes"" like the 1947 March and May events (q.v.), which caused only mild shaking, have occurred on this part of the coast, determining an appropriate magnitude for an earthquake large enough to cause a tsunami and close enough for it to arrive within a short time, but only large enough to cause moderate intensities is problematic. However, a large strong shaking plate interface earthquake (magnitude greater than 8 with maximum shaking intensities of MM8 and larger) is not indicated.
According to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Vol 1, Burns first came to NZ about 1830. A short time after February 1831 he returned to NZ as a trader at or near Mahia. Early in 1832 he moved to inland Poverty Bay, remained a few months only, and then moved to Tolaga Bay where he remained until October 1834, when he permanently left NZ. This indicates the earthquake occurred between 1831 and 1834, not 1832-38 as suggested by Grouden (1966) and later publications based on this data. The date range is not restricted to the time Burns was in Poverty Bay (a few months in 1832) as he may have travelled on occasions to Poverty Bay from Mahia or Tolaga Bay.
A validity of 3 is assigned.","One morning I was strolling along the beautiful beach in Poverty Bay, admiring the rising sun, and watching the evolutions of the whales which were chasing each other in the bay, spouting the water to an immense height.

Epicentral locations, the time of the earthquake and estimates of magnitude, which are probably based on the distribution of felt intensities, vary between various catalogues. The earthquake generated a tsunami, which reached its greatest height above sea level at the time, 24 m, at Coelemu, with an estimated 18 m at Concepcion. There are only reports of this tsunami being experienced beyond Chile, in Peru and in the Hawaiian Islands. (NGDC Tsunami Database, March 2009)","Following the 1868 August tsunami (q.v.), which caused damage and disruption throughout the east coast of the North and South Islands and in the Chatham Islands (where there was one death), there was some discussion of previous events. During one such discussion at the Auckland branch of the NZ Institute, one of the members states that he had made many inquiries amongst the old inhabitants about “a wave that reached the Bay of Islands shortly after the great earthquake at Concepcion in 1835”, but he had not been able to “glean many particulars”. The inference is that the 1835 event was observed at the Bay of Islands, but no old inhabitants were found who could give details. This is not surprising as organised European settlement of New Zealand did not begin until 1840. The majority of the Europeans in New Zealand in 1835 were missionaries in the north of the North Island, and whalers and sealers at scattered locations in both main islands and the Chatham Islands. Few diaries exist for this period in New Zealand history. Unfortunately, one of the few known day-to-day journal writers, Henry Williams, a missionary at the Bay of Islands, was at an inland location at the head of the Hauraki Gulf at the time the tsunami would have occurred. Not only was he unable to observe the tsunami on the coast, but the first expected arrival would have been during the evening.
Nevertheless, it is credible that the tsunami reached New Zealand.","During discussion about the 1868 Peru tsunami at the Auckland branch of the NZ Institute, ""Mr. J. A. Wilson said he had made many inquiries amongst the old inhabitants about a wave that reached the Bay of Islands shortly after the great earthquake at Concepcion, but he had not been able to glean many particulars.""

The earthquake was also felt strongly at Talcahuano and Concepcion, the area that was most severely affected by the 1835 earthquake. As with many of these early earthquakes, there are various estimates of epicentral locations, the origin time and magnitude. Like the 1835 earthquake, the earthquake generated a tsunami, which flowed 900 m inland at Ancud (no heights known). The tsunami was also observed in Japan, Samoa, Tonga and in the Hawaiian Islands, where the maximum height reached above sea level at the time was 6 m, at Hilo. (NGDC Tsunami Database, March 2009).
The 1837 tsunami seems to have been larger at distant locations than the 1835 tsunami, and the heights and distributions suggest a larger magnitude than that given in the NGDC database may be more appropriate.","No record of the 1837 tsunami affecting New Zealand has been found, but few records exist for this era and no systematic search has been undertaken. Given that the 1837 event was observed in Tonga and Samoa, it is possible that the tsunami supposedly observed in the Bay of Islands in 1835 (q.v.) in fact occurred in 1837.

The vessel was eventually repaired and got off, but the anchors and mooring chains were buried under seven feet of sand and the crew had to dig them out.""
According to the Department of Conservation website (www.doc.govt.nz; history of Curio Bay area), “The first Europeans in the area were sealers and whalers. A short-lived whaling station was established just inside Waikawa Harbour entrance in 1838. It was abandoned by 1844.” Given this description, the present-day settlement of Waikawa, situated on the southern shore of an extensive estuary a kilometre or so beyond the harbour entrance, is somewhat further from the entrance than the whaling station in 1838-9. The harbour appears to be well protected from sea waves, but the estuary may have changed considerably since 1839. Nevertheless, assuming that the sailors of the time were completely familiar with tidal flows, local tidal eccentricities and vagaries of the weather, it is difficult to find an explanation for the quite sudden and damaging effects described. A tsunami is a credible explanation, not only of the sudden change in tidal current, but also the burying of the anchors and mooring chains in sand as well as the beaching of the vessel. A moderate water height above sea level at the time of 1-1.5 m is inferred from the lack of reports of significant impact on the shore.
There are no known local earthquakes (NZ National Earthquake Information Database), no record of any sea level disturbances elsewhere noted in McNab (1913) and no regional or distant source tsunami in ITDB (2004) or NGDC databases. Nevertheless, the descriptive account is credible, and hence a validity of 3 is assigned.","The Margaret Rait, a whaling ship, experienced a sudden increase in tidal current while lying partly dismantled in Waikawa. The bow anchor chain was parted,  the after mooring chains tore the whole starboard quarter out, and the ship was washed onto the shore.

In August, 1840 … a wave of this character threw H.M.S. Buffalo on shore at Whitianga (Mercury Bay) and wrecked her. Tokato block (between Te Araroa and Hicks Bay) was strewn with fish.""
The wrecking of the HMZ Buffalo at Whitianga was unquestionably caused by a storm on 28 July 1840 (see, for example, Riddle, J. 1996. Saltspray and sawdust; almost certainly in books on NZ shipwrecks). On the other hand, the stranding of the fish at Tokato Block, west of East Cape, may be related to a tsunami. The stranding of fish often occurs in a tsunami with water levels as little as 1 m above normal although more reliably occurring at greater heights, and in fact, could be considered an identifying feature of a tsunami.
The referenced source for McKay's statement has not been found, and no in-depth searching of diaries or journals, few of which would be available along the east coast for this time, has been carried out. Hence, it is not known whether the unusual sea-level disturbances were experienced over a wider area.

The earthquake was felt from Tauranga in the North Island, to Nelson in the northern part of the South Island.
In Wanganui, many chimneys and some brick buildings were damaged, there was a landslide from Shakespeare Cliff, as well as conspicuous ground cracking and differential settlement of the river banks. Eiby tentatively suggested that the ground damage and reported changes in levels in Wanganui may represent faulting in the riverbed, with associated regional deformation.
However, based on new information relating to ground damage (landslides, liquefaction) near Napier and southwards along the coast to Kairakau Beach, the earthquake has been tentatively relocated to western Hawke’s Bay. The new data are compatible with a magnitude close to M7.6. Further in-depth historical research and geological investigation of potential earthquake sources within the macroseismic area are needed and may change the location, depth and magnitude of the earthquake. (Extracted and abridged from Downes & Dowrick, 2009)
Of importance as far as tsunami is concerned is that there is now no possibility of a tsunami generated by tectonically generated ground deformation.","During the strong earthquake shaking (MM7-8) that occurred in Wanganui in the 1843 July 8 earthquake, the river was strongly agitated and a large portion of Shakespeare cliff opposite the European settlement fell into the river, and ""large waves rolled up the river in a fearful manner"" (Downes, 1915), the river was covered with bubbles; and the river suddenly ran some few feet up the bank and then subsided.
De Lange (1986) and Fraser (1998) suggest that the large waves observed to roll up the Wanganui River on 8 July 1843 were more probably seiching in association with a large earthquake rather than earthquake deformation. At the time of Fraser’s analysis, the NZ Earthquake Information Database location for the earthquake was near Wanganui (based on Eiby (1968)). New evidence of ground damage (landslides, liquefaction) near Napier and southwards along the coast to Kairakau Beach now suggests that this event was closer to Hawke’s Bay, possibly on its western margins, well away from the coast (Downes & Dowrick, 2009)
Because of relocation, there is now no possibility that earthquake deformation caused a tsunami at Wanganui. Seiching in the river induced by earthquake shaking (i.e. the passage of surface waves) during the earthquake is highly likely, as suggested by de Lange (1986) and Fraser (1998). However, the inundation of the river bank and waves in the river may also have been caused by the landslide at Shakespeare Cliff (within sight of Wanganui town centre) falling into the river or by the differential settlement or slumping that occurred along the river bank.
A validity of 2 is assigned for landslide-generated tsunami.","During strong earthquake shaking -  part of Shakespeare cliff fell into the river, ""large waves rolled up the river in a fearful manner"" (Downes, 1915);  the river was strongly agitated (Porter, 1974; Church Missionary Record, 1843); a large portion of a cliff opposite the European settlement fell down into the river (Taylor, 1843; Churton, 1845)); the river was covered with bubbles; and a man who was standing at the bank, up to his ankles, washing a shirt, told me the water had suddenly risen to his knees, and then gone down again (Wakefield, 1845); water suddenly ran some few feet up the bank and then subsided (Churton, 1845)",,Listed and discussed in de Lange & Healy (1986) and Fraser (1998).

Richard Taylor, the tide at Wanganui on 6 July 1845 rose to high water mark twice in the space of two hours, at about 13:00 and again at about 15:00, the tide ebbing in between these times. Later that day an earthquake was experienced.
According to NIWA Tide forecaster (http://www.niwascience.co.nz/services/tides), high tide should have occurred at the entrance to the Wanganui River at approximately 11:00 NZMT on July 6 (noting that local solar time was used in this era). Hence the rise to high tide at 13:00 and again at 15:00 is somewhat strange. The fluctuation is clearly pre-earthquake, and there are no other known earthquakes in New Zealand or any tsunami or large earthquakes listed in NGDC that could be the source. Perhaps, storm surge set in along the coast or a small flood arrived. Nothing is mentioned in newspapers in Wellington and Nelson. Other records for Wanganui have not been searched.

Fifty four of the 56 people in the village were killed in the landslide, which flowed into the lake carrying trees with it.
The site was devastated again and many killed by a landslide from the same source in 1910 March 20 (q.v.). On that occasion, a tsunami occurred in the lake, the surges being large enough to cause problems for some children in the water on the opposite shore (Motutere?).
While no waves or surges are mentioned in the account of the 1846 event, a taniwa [taniwha] is, i.e. “The natives say that afterwards the Taniwa fled across the lake to Motutere and thence to Waikato, whence he will go to the sea and perish there; they shall be no more troubled with him; they saw the splash of his tail as lie crossed the lake” (New Zealand Spectator & Cook's Strait Guardian 1 July 1846). According to King et al. (2007), events involving large waves, storm surges and tsunamis were commonly explained as the work of taniwha in Maori traditional stories. In light of this, it is likely that the taniwha in the lake after the landslide in 1846 represents a tsunami.
The occurrence of a tsunami is given a validity of 3 (probable).
Interestingly, the account indicates another landslide 10 years before 1846, before organised European settlement.","On May 7 1846, a large landfslide fell from the thermal cliffs [Hipaua Cliffs] behind the village at Te Rapa, overwhelming it and burying it in 3 m of mud and rocks, killing 54 people.

The extent of historically observed surface fault rupture, as well as the isoseismal map, indicates that the first shock had a magnitude of at least M7.4-7.5 (Grapes et al. 1998). There has been extensive geological investigation of the Awatere Fault in the last decade to precisely map the trace and investigate fault rupture history, that is, single-event displacement, segmentation, recurrence intervals and slip rates. Mason & Little (2006) find geological evidence to confirm the historically observed fault length of c. 105 km, and also discuss geological evidence for rupture extending to the southwest beyond Barefells Pass and to the northeast into Cook Strait. Using geological data, Mason & Little (2006) estimate a moment magnitude of MW 7.4-7.7. (Extracted and abridged from Downes & Dowrick, 2009).
Aftershocks were very numerous. Two, on October 17th at 3.40 p.m., and October 19th at 5 a.m., were noted as particularly severe in Wellington, and were at least magnitude 6 (Eiby, 1980). Historical accounts (transcribed in Grapes et al. 2003) indicate that the mainshock occurred during particularly stormy weather with rain and strong winds – a factor in interpreting whether a tsunami or tsunamis occurred in conjunction with it. The wind abated on October 17 and resumed by October 19 with further gales.
","There are several accounts of sea level disturbances that have been interpreted as possible tsunami (for example, by de Lange & Healy (1986)) on three days during the 1848 October Marlborough earthquakes: on October 16, the day of the mainshock; and October 19, when a major aftershock occurred, and on October 18 (all NZMT).
According to one account (Collinson et al (1848), transcribed and annotated in Grapes et al. (2003)), “eight hours after the first shock, it being high water but neap tides, the tide rose in Wellington one foot [0.3 m] above ordinary spring tides” i.e. the rise occurred on October 16 at about 9.40 am local solar time. Another account remarks that “the vagaries of the inflow and receding of the waters ... were remarkable”, (Ironside (1891), transcribed and annotated in Grapes et al. (2003). However, Grapes et al (2003) give this account little credence, as there is clear confusion with the effects and uplift, and almost certainly the tsunami, that occurred in the 1855 January 23 Wairarapa earthquake (q.v.).
Another account (Fitzherbert (1855), transcribed and annotated in Grapes et al. (2003)), notes one extraordinary high tide, 0.45 m above ordinary tide level, “during the period of the earthquakes”, which was “not contemporaneous with any particular shock, and may be rationally accounted for otherwise”, i.e. by the high winds and heavy rain. Contemporary accounts show unequivocally that the one high sea level referred to by Fitzherbert occurred on the morning of October 18 (NZMT), when it flooded the foreshore at several locations. Collinson’s account, which was written a month after the earthquakes, is almost certainly incorrect and the date should be October 18, and then the time given by Collinson coincides with the exceptionally high spring tide on this date (see database entry for this date).
According to the NGDC tsunami database, Soloviev (1975) noted that sea disturbances were recorded at Wanganui and Nelson. However, no evidence of these has been found in Grapes et al. (2003).
The lack of a tsunami being recorded at any time during the sequence of earthquakes, including the mainshock, is consistent with accounts written some years after the 1848 earthquake (Clarke, 1855; Davie, 1870; Jolliffe, 1855; fully referenced and transcribed in Grapes et al. (2003)). It is not clear whether these include locations other than Wellington.
It cannot be ruled out entirely that a small tsunami occurred in Wellington and near source in association with the mainshock, unobserved because it was night and low tide at the time of the earthquake. For this reason, a validity of 1 (very doubtful, highly unlikely) and a water elevation at the shore of less than 0.2 m in Wellington is assigned."," [Primary accounts only, usually quoted rather than abridged; see transcriptions for other accounts related to tsunami; and Grapes et al. (2003) for full transcriptions] On October 16, eight hours after the first shock, it being high water but neap tides, the tide rose in Wellington one foot above ordinary spring tides; but this might have been occasioned by a strong S.E. wind, which lasted the 15th and 16th."" (Collinson et al, 1848); One extraordinary high tide occurred during the period of the earthquakes; it was not, however, contemporaneous with any particular shock, and may be rationally accounted for otherwise. The south-east wind, which blows directly into the harbour, had prevailed for a long time, and, as unusually large quantity of rain having fallen, the harbour was overflowed. The rise of tide was about 18 in. above its ordinary level. (Fitzherbert, 1848); This morning [Oct 18] the tide rose to an unusual height, overflowing part of Lambton Quay and all those sections at the head of the Bay fronting the water and immediately adjoining the swamp.  [Secondary accounts]The tide does not appear in 1848 to have been affected, except in one instance, and that only by wind and rain (Clarke, 1855); no tidal disturbances appear to have been noticed (Davie, 1870); It was considered providential that the heaviest shocks had occurred at low-water tides. The vagaries of the inflow and receding of the waters caused no doubt by submarine action, were remarkable. There was a fear lest we might have a tidal wave, submerging all the low flats; so great numbers bivouacked on the Western Hills. It was a melancholy, unique, and, withall interesting sight. (Ironside, 1891); These tidal phenomena never occurred before during the previous shocks not even during the severe ones in 1848"".

Three accounts (NZ Spectator 18 October 1848; day-to-day diaries of H Chapman in Westminister Review (1849) and Godfrey Thomas (1848), transcribed and annotated in Grapes et al. (2003)), indicate that the sea level was unusually high in Wellington on the morning of October 18, overflowing the shoreline and flowing into the lower parts of houses at Lambton Quay and Te Aro, and into the Maori village at Pipitea. It is clear that this is the “one extraordinary high tide [that] occurred during the period of the earthquakes” which was 0.45 m above ordinary level, described by Fitzherbert (1855) (transcribed and annotated in Grapes et al. (2003)). It is clear that a further account (Collinson (1855) transcribed and annotated in Grapes et al. (2003)) also describes the same high tide, 0.3 m above normal spring tides, although the date is incorrectly given as October 16 (q.v.). Several accounts suggest the strong southeast gales could account for the high sea level.
On the same day, a “remarkably” high tide was recorded at New Plymouth, accompanied by one of the heaviest NW gales ever experienced there (Wellington Independent 22 Nov 1848). Heavy waves were also experienced at around 04:00 on October 18 near Warea, just north of Cape Taranaki, where Maori boats were smashed, a camp was flooded and a woman was swept away (later rescued).
The NIWA Tide Forecaster (www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides), which facilitates hindcast of tides around New Zealand, indicates that the high tide at 9.50 am local solar time on October 18 in Wellington at 0.72 m above mean sea level was higher than the Mean HW Perigean-Spring (MHWPS) or ""king"" tide level of 0.64 m (R.Bell, NIWA, pers. comm.). The days when MHWPS tides occur are considered hazardous because only a small to moderate sea level rise from storm surge or wind wave is needed for the coastline in low-lying areas to be overtopped. Many accounts of the 1848 earthquakes mention stormy conditions at the time of the mainshock and on subsequent days (see Grapes et al. 2003), and fortuitously In fact, the twice-daily records of barometric pressure kept by H S Chapman at Karori (Westminster Review, 1848) and HMS Fly at sea-level (Spectator, 25 October 1848) suggest a significant and relatively sudden fall in barometric pressure during the night of October 17, from sea-level readings of 29.45 (997.3 hPa) at midnight to 29.19 (988.5 hPa) at 8 am on October 18, dropping slightly lower (986.8 hPa) later in the day (see below or transcriptions for graph of the data). Chapman’s records suggest a greater variation.
The absolute value of the nadir in barometric pressure, if correct, and extent and suddenness of the fall are consistent with the arrival of a moderate depression, capable of generating storm surge of about 0.25 m. (R. Bell, pers. comm.). Such storm surge in conjunction with exceptionally high MHPWS tide levels would be capable of a 30 cm rise in water levels at the time of high tide on October 18, consistent with Collinson et al’s (1848) statement that ”the tide rose in Wellington one foot above ordinary spring tides” and Fitzherbert’s that the tide rose about 18 inches (45 cm) above ordinary levels. Significantly, the time of high tide on October 18 corresponds with Collinson et al’s (1848) time for the flooding, consistent with this account having the correct time, but incorrect date. Another high tide, which the NIWA Forecaster calculates to be a similar height to that on October 18, was recorded on October 19, although this did not cause any alarm or damage. However, by this time the barometric pressure was rising.
Given the fact that the flooding of the foreshore in Wellington occurred over 17 hours after the large October 17 aftershock, none of the descriptive accounts suggest several rises and falls as would be expected in a tsunami, and most significantly, the high water levels can be explained by a combination of storm surge and very high spring tide levels, a tsunami is not indicated and given a validity of 0. The lack of tsunami is consistent with Fitzherbert’s (1848) statement that: while “one extraordinary high tide occurred during the period of the earthquakes; it was not, however, contemporaneous with any particular shock, and may be rationally accounted for otherwise [i.e. by wind and rain].”
Given the lack of tsunami in Cook Strait, the high water levels in Taranaki on October 18 are most easily explained by swell and wind wave set-up by the strong north-west gales, and possibly storm surge, as the tides were not exceptionally high spring tides.
The assignment of a validity of 0 to this event is in contrast to de Lange & Healy (1986), who assign a reliability index of 3 to the occurrence of a tsunami at sometime during the period of the Marlborough earthquake and major aftershocks.

A very high tide occurred in Wellington at an unspecified time on 19 October according to Fitzherbert (1848). In an account written some months after the earthquake, it is remarked that on October 19 agitation in the Hutt River preceded or accompanied the large aftershock at around 5 am (Hansard 1848). (Hansard (1848) and Fitzherbert (1848) are transcribed and annotated in Grapes et al. (2003))
If the agitation preceded the earthquake, then the source is uncertain, but is unlikely to be tsunami. If it accompanied the earthquake, the disturbance could be seiching, or shaking effects on the sediments in the river, but the timing is inconsistent with tsunami. Eiby (1980) argues that the observer may have been mistaken as to the time and the possibility of tsunami is not precluded. Nevertheless, a tsunami was not observed elsewhere and agitation of ponds and rivers is a common effect of strong shaking and the passage of seismic waves.
The high tide can be explained by a high MHPWS tide (Mean HW Perigean-Spring (MHWPS) or ""king"" tide level), which was marginally higher than that on October 18. Presumably it was not accompanied by storm surge (by this time the barometric pressure was rising, as noted in the database entry for the October 18 event) and therefore not alarming.

No doubt, other documents will be found from time to time.
Full transcriptions of all the source material on the earthquake known in 1999 are given in Downes & Grapes (1999).","The 1855 January 23 Wairarapa earthquake at about 9.11 pm local [solar] time is the largest magnitude historical earthquake to have occurred in New Zealand since organized European colonisation began in 1840. A comprehensive seismological, geological and geotechnical study analysing more than 200 historical documents by Grapes & Downes (1997) discusses all aspects of the earthquake and its effects.
The earthquake was felt over a large part of the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It was severely damaging to settlements in the southern half of the North Island, particularly Wellington and Wanganui, and in the northeastern part of the South Island, reaching a maximum intensity of MM9 (based on building damage) to MM10 (based on extent of landsliding in the Orongorongo and Rimutaka ranges) At least five, possibly nine, deaths occurred, all from earthquake, not tsunami. There was widespread occurrence of landslides, and liquefaction (expulsion of water and sand, lateral spreading and differential settlement) in the most severely shaken areas (MM8 and above). Seismic seiches were generated by earthquake shaking in rivers, lakes, estuaries and harbours as far north as Bay of Plenty and at least as far south as Canterbury (Grapes & Downes, 1997). A seiche was also reported in the Derwent River, Hobart, Australia (Downes, new data).
A large tsunami occurred in Cook Strait, washing away a shed 9 m above sea level at Te Kopi in Palliser Bay and sweeping inland at Lyall Bay and Evans Bay to inundate what is now the suburb of Miramar. Shops in Lambton Quay in central Wellington were flooded. 1-2m waves reached far north as Waikawa and possibly as far south as Kaikoura. Water levels in Wellington Harbour and in Cook Strait oscillated for 8-12 hours after the earthquake. (Grapes & Downes, 1997)
Historical documents record up to 3 m of vertical movement along what is now known as the Wairarapa Fault, with rupture extending from near Mauriceville towards the Palliser Bay coast, accompanied by uplift and tilting of the land west of the fault to the coast north and west of Wellington. Coastal uplift was measured at several locations; the maximum uplift recorded was 2.7 m along the south coast near Muka Muka (Grapes & Downes, 1997). However, uplift is now recognized to have reached a maximum of 6.4 m northeast of Turakirae Point (McSaveney et al., 2006). Historical descriptions indicate that the earthquake also caused tectonic subsidence of about 0.9 m at the northern end of the Wairau River valley (Grapes & Downes, 1997; Garin, 1855 (transcribed here)). The occurrence of a large tsunami indicates that uplift and fault rupture continued offshore into Cook Strait.
Although strike-slip (horizontal) movement on the fault was not recognised historically, recent geological studies at 16 localities support the inference that dextral slip reached 18.7 m and averaged ~16 m over the 16 km length of the Wairarapa Fault that was studied (Rodgers & Little, 2006). Other geological evidence suggests that rupture of the Alfredton Fault occurred in the early 19th or late 18th century, possibly in conjunction with the 1855 rupture of the Wairarapa Fault, hence possibly extending the rupture length by about 30 km (Schermer et al., 2004).
Numerous aftershocks, including some with magnitudes approaching 7, were experienced. A report from Kekerengu on the Kaikoura coast suggests that at least one aftershock was more severe than the principal shock felt in the same area. This could have been local and initiated close to Kekerengu, outside the main rupture zone of the seaward extension of the Wairarapa Fault. (Grapes & Downes, 1997)
Using elastic dislocation modelling, Darby & Beanland (1992) and more recently Beavan & Darby. (2005) have developed several source models to best fit known deformation data. All models require slip on the deeper part of the plate interface from the intersection of the Wairarapa Fault (>18 km) to about 30 km depth. Subsidence in the northern South Island requires oblique slip on the interface at depth. Less than 2 m or no slip occurred on the shallow part of the plate interface. The best fit models require movement on the Wairarapa Fault within 4-5 km of the surface to be transferred to the Wharekauhau Thrust, and a small splay fault to account for a narrow peak in the uplift profile.
The moment magnitudes (Mw) derived from the elastic dislocation models lie in the range 8.0 - 8.4, preferably 8.2-8.4. Rodgers & Little (2006) and Grapes & Downes (1997), using fault length and slip parameters, obtain a magnitude that is within this range. (Extracted and abridged from Downes & Dowrick, 2009).","The 1855 January 23 0932 UT 2111 Local Solar time MW8.2-8.4 Wairarapa earthquake generated New Zealand’s largest historical locally-generated tsunami. The tsunami most affected the Cook Strait region, where the Wairarapa Fault and subsidiary faults (Wharekauhau Thrust and small play fault) ruptured beneath Cook Strait causing significant uplift (up to 6.4 m) of a large region west of the fault on the northern side of the strait and a small amount of subsidence on the southern side. The effects of the tsunami were observed at least as far north as Waikawa Beach, where fish were deposited above high water mark, and as far south as the Clarence River mouth and possibly Kaikoura, although evidence for the latter is equivocal. A bore in the Avon River attributed by De Lange & Healy (1986) to tsunami and the “great sea wave” in Otago harbour (Davie, 1870; see transcriptions) were almost certainly seismically induced seiches, not tsunami. Seiches, often confused with tsunami on the coast, were observed in coastal rivers and estuaries at Wairoa (Hawke’s Bay), Motupipi in Golden Bay, Kaiapoi and at Lyttelton, as well as in many inland water bodies.
The greatest known height (10-11 m) reached by the tsunami was at Te Kopi in Palliser Bay, where a shed on a cliff 9 m above the sea was swept away. Here also, on the night of the earthquake and tsunami, a sailor who had experienced a tsunami in South America, persuaded a family to leave the shore. Nearby, at Whangaimoana, a tool that had been on the shore at the time of the earthquake was found many years later in a location 10 m above high water mark. High waves were also observed along the coast south of Wellington and along the Wairau Bar on the southern shore of Cook Strait, probably reaching 6-7 m near Rarangi. In Lyall Bay the tsunami swept about 2-2.5 km inland, inundating what is now the suburb of Miramar. The sea sweeping in from Lyall Bay (est. height above sea level at time, 4-5 m) reportedly met the water sweeping in from Evans Bay, on the Wellington Harbour side of Rongotai Isthmus (est. height above sea level at time 3-4 m).
Within Wellington Harbour, water levels varied considerably. At Petone and along the road to the Hutt Valley, fish were deposited (the tide was high at the time of the earthquake) but the water levels do not seem to have reached much more than a metre or so above normal. However, the shops along the beach front at Lambton Quay (now on reclaimed land 200 m from the shore) were inundated with waves about 1.4-2.4 m above sea level at the time immediately after or during the earthquake. Barnett et al. (1991) (and subsequently Grapes & Downes (1997)) separated the source of the tsunami within the harbour into three different components: the horizontal movement, causing an immediate “slosh”; differential vertical movement across the harbour; and the much greater deformation in Cook Strait and extending across the whole region west of the fault.
For a local source tsunami, the duration seems to have been quite long, observations consistently indicating that in Wellington harbour and in Cook Strait water levels oscillated for 8-12 hours. It was also said that the tides were irregular for a week (see entries for January 24-31, January 24 and February 3). However, it is uncertain whether this observation represents further small tsunami caused by large aftershocks (possibly triggering submarine or coastal landslides) or lack of familiarity with new tide levels caused by uplift and subsidence.",see individual observations,,"Listed in Laing (1954), de Lange & Healy (1986) and Fraser (1998).

Grapes & Downes (1997) record that aftershocks of the January 23 earthquake were numerous, and at least five had magnitudes between M6.5-7.0. Only some of these would have been centred near Cook Strait, others would have been beneath land. Nevertheless, many shocks were felt strongly in Wellington and some were felt strongly on the northeast coast of the South Island. At least one of these shocks was seen to cause a coastal landslide (northeast Marlborough coast, see database entries for January 24-25 and February 03) and a small tsunami. Other aftershocks were almost certainly capable of triggering submarine or coastal landslides, possibly weakened by the main event. These may account for the week-long long duration of the tidal disturbances. However, it is possible also that people had yet to recognise the new tide levels following uplift of a 30 km wide region west of Wairarapa Fault as well as subsidence of a small part of the northern South Island near the Wairau River.","He [Weld] mentioned the great disturbance of the tides for some weeks after Jany 23/55 and this all along the shores of Cook's Straits so that when they at length settled into a state of equilibrium adjusted to the new levels it would render the estimate of the rising or sinking of the land very vague except in favoured spots. (Lyell, 1856a); For several days there were other movements and waves rolled along the coast for a distance of 50 miles. In a place called ""The Flags"", between Cape Campbell and Waipepo [Waipapa] on the second day after the first earthquake of the 23rd January, several men employed to load logs on a ship distinctively saw an earthquake approaching them from a point called White Rocks, located 3 miles northward. It approached them in a NW - SE direction, and was made visible by stones rolling from the top of the cliffs, by landslides, clouds of dust and a sea wave. (Lyell, 1856d); On the S. side of Cooks straits the tides after Jany 1855 were irregular at the White Bluff & in the Wairau for weeks.(Lyell, 1856e);  The rise of the convulsion [caused] great waves of the sea rolled in upon the coast, and for several weeks the tides were irregular.... When Mr Roberts left New Zealand, three months after the earthquake, there had been no sinking of the upraised land, and he felt persuaded that he could not have failed to notice even a slight change of level had any occurred.  He ascertained ten weeks after the shock that there had certainly been no subsidence whatever on the coast at Pencarrow Head, and the tides were so irregular long after the earthquake, in the harbour of Port Nicholson and elsewhere, that the supposed partial sinking of the coast which some believed to have taken place might perhaps be deceptive.   It is surprising how soon the signs of a recent change of level on a coast are effaced to all eyes but those of the scientific observer, especially where there is a rise and fall of the tides.   (Lyell, 1868); ... I should mention the great sea-wave which came in immediately after the first shock, about 5 feet higher than the highest tide inside the harbour, and 12 feet higher outside; the tide (i.e. water surface) continued ebbing and flowing every 20 minutes during the night, and was most irregular for a week, ebbing further than ever known before. After that time it became more regular; and now the ebb and flow is the same as before the earthquake; but since that, it does not come at high water within 3 or 4 feet of its former height, proving that the whole southern part of the northern island has been raised, the elevated portion commencing at Wangarner [Wanganui?], on the west coast, and going round to Castle Point on the east, where it terminates.

An aftershock on February 03, felt by several men loading wool on boats at a location called The Flags (Wharenui) on this coast at an unspecified time, is possibly one of these, as a strong earthquake does not seem to have been felt closer to the rupture zone of the mainshock. Earthquakes at unspecified times on this day were noted nearby in the Awatere Valley, and a ""smart"" earthquake was felt in Wellington at about 22:00 (local solar time) on the same day (see aftershock table in Grapes & Downes, 1997).
The earthquake’s effects, which suggest a small tsunami, were noted by one of the men in his day-to-day journal: “Saw a heavy shock out at sea. It made the sea appear on the horizon like a hilly and undulating country; it also caused a swell on the beach for about an hour after.” Several other accounts from another source (Sir Charles Lyell), suggest different dates (January 24 or 25), but the description is so similar (apart from the men loading wood, not wool) that it was almost certainly the same event, “At a place called the Flags between Cape Campbell and Waipapa, some men were loading a vessel with wood, when they saw distinctly an earthquake approaching them from a point called 'the White Rocks,' 3 miles to the northward.

It was followed by aftershocks and accompanied by roaring of the sea and water being “thrown up much beyond its usual height on the beach”.
The occurrence of aftershocks indicates the earthquake was at relatively shallow depth. Although described as severe at Wairoa and “the Station”, it does not appear to have caused any damage. At Table Cape, it was not strongly felt; at Gisborne, it was felt as a sharp shock by the Williams family; at Napier, it may have been one of the several shocks felt by Rev Colenso. Colenso noted that the shocks that had been felt following the 1855 January 23 Wairarapa earthquake (which was centred 200 km to the south) had at this time reduced to 2-3 per week. At Wairoa the earthquake was not as long as the January 23 event (in which the intensity was MM5, and seiching occurred in the river) but supposedly much more severe. Neither Colenso nor Williams lived close enough to the coast to observe a tsunami.
A location nearby to Mahia Peninsula at a standard crustal depth of 12 km and a magnitude of 5.0-5.5 are tentatively assigned (as the earthquake has not yet been assigned a location in the New Zealand Earthquake Information Database).","The 1855 February 12 M5.0-5.5 earthquake, here called the Mahia earthquake, was accompanied by roaring of the sea and water being “thrown up much beyond its usual height on the beach”.
It is not clear from the only account of this event (Hamlin, 1855) where this sea disturbance occurred, at Table Cape or at a location called the “station”, whose location is uncertain. It may have been settlements at Mahia or Mahia Beach, perhaps a whaling station or possibly Hamlin’s “home” station at Wairoa. Several whaling stations were at one time located on or near Mahia Peninsula: at Waikokopu (operating in 1848), at Kinikini, another at Te Hoe near Mahia Beach, all on the western side of Mahia Peninsula.
Nevertheless, earthquakes of this magnitude are too small to cause tsunami through deformation, but are capable (just) of triggering coastal or submarine landslides, which may cause tsunami. The tides at the time were approaching average spring tides, and would not have caused unexpectedly high sea levels. Hence, the tsunami, which can only have been small (1-2? m) and localised, is assigned a validity of 2.","""About half past 12 o’clock this night [Feb 12] a very severe earthquake.

Its approach from a south-easterly direction was visible at sea before impact. Its effects (not specified) were observed a short time later at several places along the beach between the Waihao River mouth and Timaru, but no unusual effects were noted in Timaru. During the same month, possibly the same day, a small rise and fall at low tide was also noted at Akaroa, ~ 160 km from Waihao River.
A submarine or coastal landslide generated tsunami is consistent with the relatively local effects of this event. Submarine slump and coastal landslide sources are locally present. An offshore fan is associated with the Waitaki River, which is less than 20 km to the south of Waihao River mouth, and the coast to the south of the Waihao River is composed of coastal cliffs, which were once part of the Waitaki River fan and are now actively eroding (Single, 2006).
As far as the height of waves needed to wash into the lagoons, Single (2006) notes that north of the Waihao River, the coast has a sand and gravel barrier beach ridge fronting low-lying hinterland with lagoons. Storm waves of 2.5 m can overtop the beach, while the barrier ridge near the Wainono lagoon area (~8 km north of the Waihao River mouth) is 5-7 m high. Assuming that the coast, although retreating, had a similar profile in 1856 as it has now, waves of at least 2.5 m and possibly as high as 5-7 m are needed to match the observations in 1856. Note that the Waihao River may have exited to the sea in a different location from today, and hence it is uncertain where the observer was in 1856.
The descriptive account mentions no earthquake that might have triggered a landslide. Several earthquakes were reported felt in Wellington and Marlborough in March 1856, but their effects are unknown in South Canterbury. However, the earthquake catalogue for this period is incomplete.
De Lange & Healy (1986) note that Laing (1954) suggested that the tsunami may have been that detected at Awu on 2 March 1856, but they consider a source on the southern flank of the Chatham Rise is more probable. Another event, only noted at the Waihao River mouth, occurred in the same location in 1970 (q.v.) in association with heavy seas.
De Lange & Healy (1986) assigned a low reliability index to this event, which is retained as a validity of 2 with unknown source, possibly spontaneous local submarine landslide or meteo-tsunami.","A wave “many feet in height” was observed (by one person only) to break violently along the beach near the Waihao River mouth, washing into the lagoons.

From the top of the Bluff, the rock off Ahuriri Bluff was visible in the troughs of the waves. Ships were unable to leave port. It was reported that there was insufficient wind in Hawke Bay or along the coast to account for the heavy sea and it was thought to be caused by southeast winds between Napier and Wellington. After the sea becomes smooth the water level is still high.
Tide heights predicted by NIWA’s Tide Forecaster (http://www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides) for the period 6-10 August 1858 vary from small spring in the afternoon of August 6 to just over Mean HW Perigean Spring (MHWPS) or “King” tide on the evening of August 10, accounting for high water levels reported for the later part of the period.
When considered in conjunction with high spring tides, the duration and effects of this event are more consistent with swell and possibly storm surge produced by a storm at sea rather than with tsunami. A validity of 0 is assigned.
Note that this event occurred when Napier and the surrounding area was lower than it is today, having been raised by the 1931 MS7.8 Hawke’s Bay earthquake (see description in the National Earthquake Information Database, and on the GeoNet website, www.geonet.org.nz).

Careful consideration should be given to choosing the most appropriate earthquake parameters for tsunami propagation models and for scenario development by Emergency Management for response in a Tsunami Warning situation.","The tsunami from the 1868 August 13 MW8.8-9.3 Southern Peru earthquake first arrived at the main islands of New Zealand early am on August 15. Observations of the tsunami were reported from nearly 90 locations, mainly on the eastern seaboard from Mangonui, in Northland, to Riverton, in Southland, as well as at Nelson and Motueka and at Westport and Greymouth on the West Coast of the South Island and at Wanganui on the west coast of the North Island. It was also observed throughout the Chatham Islands, arriving just after midnight, the greatest water height above sea level at the time reaching 10 m at Owenga on the east coast, washing away several huts and damaging boats. At Tupuanga (Tupuangi) on the northwest coast of Chatham Island, the dwellings of entire Maori village were washed away, the 60-70 residents escaping after the first of three large waves reached the floor of their dwellings. One death occurred nearby at Waitangi West when a person tried to rescue a boat between waves. A European-style house was completely destroyed at Te Raki Bay, the two occupants barely escaping. Damage occurred at other locations on Chatham Island, and an inundation map, dated September 1868, showing water heights as broad or narrow bands of yellow dependent on height, indicates water heights from 1.8 m to over 6 m generally.
The areas most affected in the North and South islands were around Great Barrier Island, eastern Bay of Plenty, Napier, Canterbury, especially Bank’s Peninsula, and Oamaru. Fifteen locations reported water heights above sea level at the time of 2 m or more. The greatest reported heights were at Little Akaloa (4.5-5.0 m), and Le Bons Bay (5.8-7.6 m), although the latter may have been overestimated by observers. At Westport, water levels of 1.2-1.5 m above normal were experienced. Bores were observed in the Waimakariri, Heathcote and Avon Rivers, in Canterbury, the Awatere River in Marlborough, and in eastern Bay of Plenty, the greatest distance from the coast being in the Awatere River (15 km).
The tsunami damaged boats, and moved moorings and buoys at many places. Around Bank’s Peninsula, many wharves, bridges, and fences were damaged or destroyed, and several houses were inundated. The effects may have been significantly greater, had some of the largest waves occurred at higher tide levels, particularly about Bank’s Peninsula. Along much of the South Island and southern half of the North Island east coast the first few hours of waves occurred when the tides were below MSL. This and the arrival of the first waves during the night contributed to the first waves not being well observed and in many cases, the first observed waves being many hours after the forecast arrival time (calculated using ITDB, 2004). On the West Coast, the tsunami was first noticed about 10 hours after the first observed arrivals on the east coast. The waves were greatest within the first 12-20 hours of arrival, and sea level did not return to normal for at least 2-3 days.",see individual observations,,"Listed in Laing (1954), de Lange & Healy (1986) and Fraser (1998).

However, accounts from newspapers of the day are fairly complete.","The 1868 October 18 1235 UT October 19 0005 NZMT MW7.2-7.6 Cape Farewell earthquake was felt over a large part of the North and South Islands of New Zealand, with the highest intensities in Taranaki and in Northwest Nelson. Damage to chimneys and buildings, as well as conspicuous ground damage, consistent with intensities of MM8, possibly MM9, occurred in the Collingwood to Farewell Spit area At least 100 aftershocks were felt near Farewell Spit in the 10 days after the earthquake. At least ten of these were also distinctly felt in Hokitika, Nelson, Wellington, Wanganui and New Plymouth, suggesting magnitudes of ca. 6.
The macroseismic epicentre of the earthquake is close to the offshore extension of the Wakamarama Fault, this section of the fault being identified as a reverse fault with a subdued expression at the sea floor suggesting past rupture to the sub-surface only. However, it has not yet been determined whether this fault ruptured in the earthquake. (Extracted and abridged from Downes & Dowrick (2009))","The 1868 October 18 1235 UT October 19 0005 NZMT MW7.2-7.6 Cape Farewell earthquake occurred just after midnight NZMT, and although people in some strongly shaken locations moved to high terraces for the rest of the night and others kept a watch for sea-level disturbances, fearing a tsunami (1868 tsunami from a large earthquake in South America had occurred only a few months previous), only a very small disturbances were observed at a few places. However, a letter (dated 3 February 1869) to a Nelson newspaper from a correspondent from Pakawau, indicates that a tsunami of 2-3 m occurred near source: “The only place I have observed of a report being made in the newspapers of a tidal wave on that occasion was at Auckland. Yet upon the sandspit [Farewell Spit] there appears to have been one of at least seven or eight feet. The masts of the Juno, which was wrecked there some two years ago, being at high water mark on the 18th [October], but when seen again in about ten days, some of them were lying on the side of some low sand hills, and others away inside the spit, where no tide has been now for a number of years. An old canoe, which has lain for years near the same place, is now further in and fully ten feet higher than where it previously lay”.
A small tsunami was also possibly observed at Waitara (<0.3 m) and Nelson (≤0.2 m). Locations that specifically indicate a tsunami was not observed were: New Plymouth, Wanganui (although a seiche may have occurred in the river), Westport (a seiche may have occurred in a stream/river; i.e. a recession of the sea occurred during the earthquake only), Greymouth, Hokitika, and Kaikoura. A significant tsunami at the latter four places would not be expected, given the source location and the probable orientation of the fault (i.e. parallel to the local faults and to the MM intensity isoseismal pattern (see Downes & Dowrick (2009)). Thames reported inundation of the foreshore on the night of the earthquake, but being on the other side of the North Island remote from the source, this location can only have been affected by the spring tides at the time, and/or storm surge or waves.",see individual observations,,Listed in Fraser (1998) only.

The tide then ebbed for about 3 or 4 hours, occasionally receding and flowing up to some boat sheds, but did not fall to normal levels at the expected time. No accounts of similar sea level fluctuations were recorded in newspapers from other locations.
According to the NIWA tide forecaster (http://www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides), high tide on January 4 at Port Taranaki occurred at 1245 NZMT. Hence, the observer had a reasonably correct time for high tide. The tidal range on January 4 was 2.8 m, which is an average range, and hence, the observer was mistaken in expecting neap tides, and may have misinterpreted the expected tide levels. The size of the ebbs and flows is not indicated, but unlikely to be particularly large given the lack of comment. Their occurrence is consistent with tsunami, but may also be the result of offshore swell. The failure to ebb may also be a sign of tsunami but might also indicate storm surge, as would the tide reaching a higher than expected tide level.
There are no large earthquakes or tsunami listed in ITDB 2004, NGDC or in the New Zealand Earthquake Information Catalogue that might be a source of the fluctuations. The slight earthquake felt at Manukau on January 3, is almost certainly unrelated. The West Coast Times of 5 January 1869, however, indicates a heavy sea at Westport. Hence swell and storm surge are a strong possibility, without the storm or wind being present locally.
It is relevant to note here that the August 1868 tsunami from Peru had a significant impact in New Zealand and following its occurrence, people were particularly observing the sea and more than usually sensitive to its behaviour and to the potential of earthquakes to cause tsunami. The flurry of “tsunami” reports in the 3 years following the 1868 event probably reflects this.
Given the uncertainty and the lack of observations elsewhere, a validity of 1 is assigned.","On Mon last [Jan 4] the tide in our roadstead exhibited extraordinary eccentricities. It was high tide at about 6 minutes past 1, when although it is the season of neap tides, it rose higher than a spring tide.

At about the time of half-flood (~ 5 am or 5 pm) a large wave broke on the shore at Westport, and there was a strong tidal current that went up the Buller River further than the usual tidal influence. According to marks on the banks, the water rose 0.6 m. The effects were noted to be similar to those experienced in the August 1868 tsunami from Peru (q.v.). At Charleston, a vessel was reportedly driven up onto the beach and at Hokitika, 120 km south of Westport, a boat was washed away. However, no report of exceptional currents or water levels has been found in the Hokitika newspaper (West Coast Times), although there is a report of a Harbour Board boat being found unsecured and floating some way offshore on the morning of 3 March. It was supposed that that the boat had been untied deliberately. . No other reference to effects in Charleston has been found. However, other newspapers that are not on the National Library “PapersPast” website (http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast), for example, the Westport Times, have not been checked.
The West Coast Times reports a rough sea on March 3 and a light wind at Hokitika. NIWA Tide Forecaster (http://www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides), indicates March 3 was a few days after the time of neap tides.
The described effects, especially if all three places are involved, are not inconsistent with tsunami, although there is no indication of more than one surge at Westport. The origin of the tsunami is unknown as there are no large earthquakes or tsunami listed in ITDB 2004, NGDC or in the New Zealand Earthquake Information Catalogue. However, small tsunami from the Solomon Islands earthquakes have been observed along this part of the West Coast of the South Island (see 1931 October and 1939 May and 2007 April entries), and global tsunami catalogues are probably incomplete for this area and era. Another possible explanation is meteo-tsunami.

Further, there was an unverified report of an unusual recession in which Landing Service boats anchored in 3.3 m (11 ft) of water were left high and dry for a short time at 5.30 am.
According to the NIWA Tide Forecaster, the tides were not abnormally high on 1 April, low tide occurring at 0054 NZMT (appropriate time for this era) and high tide at 0705 NZMT. The grounding of boats, if correct, occurred about 1.5 hours before high tide.
Although in-depth searching for extra information (e.g. from Oamaru Harbour Board records, if available) has not been done, searching the National Library “PapersPast” website (http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast) using appropriate keywords and searching newspapers without text recognition (e.g. Star, Timaru Herald) has not shown up accounts of sea-level disturbances at any other locations. Further, in both known newspaper extracts (Hawke’s Bay Herald (dated 16 April 1869); Evening Post (a Wellington newspaper; (dated 6 April 1869), the Oamaru Times 2 April 1869 is cited as the source, but no such article has been found in the newspaper itself. This may be because the Oamaru Times was a morning newspaper, and the article may have appeared in a later edition, which is not available on the National Library site.
The described effects are consistent with tsunami, and there is no other obvious explanation, in particular, of the considerable recession (although this does not seem to be followed by an equivalent rise in water levels) nor the several ebbs and flows. The Waitaki River, just north of Oamaru, is a source of sediment and has created a large onshore and offshore fan, from which slumps could occur. This would be consistent with relatively small and apparently localised tsunami. A meteo-tsunami is another possibility.

The waves occurred for at least 2 hours and possibly as long as 8-10 hours, and were likened to the effects of the 1868 tsunami. Some attributed the unusual conditions to a heavy southerly sea setting in at the heads.
Although accounts of waves in Wellington Harbour were recorded in newspapers in Hawke’s Bay, Dunedin, and Auckland, none reported any sea level disturbances locally. There are no large earthquakes, or tsunami events, in ITDB (2004) or NGDC for this date. Further there are no earthquakes known to have been felt in New Zealand on or just before this date.

The effects (rises above and recessions below normal tidal levels), and the long duration are compatible with the occurrence of a tsunami. There is no obvious observed geological source (earthquake or submarine landslide), and so swell in Cook Strait or a meteo-tsunami must be considered as possible sources.

The perpendicular rise and fall was probably never more than from six inches to a foot, but the alterations were exceedingly rapid and continued during the whole day. Some individuals attempt to account for the phenomena by attributing it to a heavy southerly sea setting in at the heads, but the idea scarcely affords a sufficient or satisfactory explanation. Others ascribe the disturbance to the occurrence of another tidal wave somewhere, and news from the localities exposed to such disagreeable visitations will be awaited with some interest. ( Wellington Independent, 9 April 1870); A rather singular disturbance in the waters of the bay was observed this morning from about 7 o’clock until after 9 o’clock, the tide rising and falling in a somewhat similar manner to what it did on the occasion of the memorable tidal wave in South America, but not nearly to such an extent. The phenomenon has been explained by the supposition that a southerly sea was setting in at the heads at the time. (Evening Post 7 April 1870)",,Not listed,,,

Matthews’ source of information about the “tidal wave” seems to have been Spencer, and his source can be traced to a contemporary newspaper.

The groin, which was hoped might have so far succeeded experimentally as to lead to an enlarged system of protection being undertaken, scarcely offered the slightest resistance to the vast bodies of water that surged over the beach, and after one or two breakers had swept over it, collapsed altogether. What the breakwater might have accomplished had the trouble and expense been taken to ballast it is a very doubtful matter, as the force of the approaching waves was unprecedented. We believe it is the first occasion since Westport suffered from the inroad of the sea that spring-tides and extraordinary rough weather have happened together, exercising a double force in expediting the work of destruction.

The earthquake travelled from NE to SW. The tide was also unusually high and flowed for about an hour after the proper time of high water.”
According to the NIWA Tide forecaster, the high tide at 09:08 NZMT was a moderately high HWS tide, about 20 cm above MHWS (Information on tidal levels at Westport is from the LINZ website) and not far short of the Highest Astronomical Tide. Hence, the most likely explanation for the abnormal tidal levels after the earthquake on May 14 is inaccurate estimation of tides rather than tsunami.
On the morning of the next day, 15 May, there was a storm event at Westport (120 km north of Hokitika) that resulted in significant erosion of the shore and flooding of parts of the town causing damage for the second time in a few weeks (see 1870 April 29-30). This was attributed at the time to the coincidence of very high spring tides and storm, which may also have affected Hokitika.

According to NIWA Forecaster, tides were not exceptional at this time, with a range of about 2.5 m.

Uplift and subsidence of the coast occurred at various points along the coast. Most of the loss of life and damage is attributed to the tsunami, which reached a maximum of 24 m above sea level at the time. (Principally from NGDC Tsunami Database, April 2009)
The earthquake followed nine years after the disastrous 1868 Southern Peru earthquake and tsunami, immediately to the north along the plate boundary. As with many of the historical earthquakes there is much uncertainty about the earthquake's location and magnitude, with locations ranging over three degrees latitude and magnitudes ranging from 8.3 (NGDC Tsunami database) to 8.8 (Comte & Pardo, 1991). Other magnitude and location estimates are available on the NGDC Tsunami Database.
The extent of tsunami effects in New Zealand suggests that the magnitude of the earthquake was greater than the MW8.3 in the NGDC Tsunami database, and more consistent with Comte & Pardo (1991) MW8.8. More recent estimates may be available. Hence, careful consideration should be given to choosing the most appropriate earthquake parameters for tsunami propagation models and for scenario development by Emergency Management for response in a Tsunami Warning situation.","The tsunami from the 1877 May 10 MW8.8 Northern Chile earthquake first arrived on the main islands of New Zealand early on the morning of 1877 May 11 NZMT. The tsunami was reported observed from nearly 50 locations, from Mangonui, in Northland, to Riverton, in Southland, and at Westport on the West Coast. It was also observed at Waitangi (est. 3-3.5 m water height above sea level at time) in the Chatham Islands, where a house and bridge were washed away and another house inundated, and at Perseverance Harbour, Campbell Island, where it did some damage and reached an estimated 3-4 m above MSL. The data are probably incomplete for the Chatham Islands.
The areas most affected areas in the North and South Islands were Northland, Coromandel, Banks Peninsula, and Oamaru, with water heights above sea level at the time reaching just over 3 m at Little Akaloa, possibly Pigeon Bay, and Akaroa. Heights of 1-1.5 were common, with 8 locations only experiencing heights of 2 m or more. Westport experienced waves with a peak-to-trough of 1.8 m, i.e. the height above sea level at the time of about 0.9-1.0 m. The tsunami was not observed at Hokitika, nor reported from other west coast North or South Island locations. Bores were observed in the Piako and Waihou Rivers near Thames, in the Waimakariri and Avon Rivers, in Canterbury.
Generally the tsunami was less pronounced than the 1868 tsunami and it not cause as much concern or damage, probably because some of the largest waves about Bank’s Peninsula and Oamaru, and along much of the South Island and southern North Island east coast occurred when the tides were below MSL. On the other hand, the Coromandel and Northland were impacted close to high tide.
The first waves of the tsunami generally arrived not long after the forecasted arrival time, (calculated using ITDB, 2004), and were greatest within the first 6-12 hours. The tsunami was first observed at Westport about 10 hours after the first arrivals on the east coast.",see individual observations,,"Listed in Laing (1954), de Lange & Healy (1986) and Fraser (1998).

It was supposedly observed by two ships, the Pretty Jane and the SS Go Ahead, which were respectively off East Cape and Waipiro Bay (historically known as Open Bay). However, it is probable that some confusion has occurred with the names of the ships, and they were in fact the same ship.
The disturbance, which was less than 400 m across, was visible in front of the ship and to seaward and was moving towards the ship faster than it could steam. The main disturbance was successfully avoided. Nevertheless the ship was tossed and pitched about until it reached smooth water.
Newspaper accounts note that a slight earthquake was felt in Gisborne about 12-24 hours previously. Gregg (1958), in analysing the reports, suggests the disturbance was “a tsunami resulting from submarine landslides or faulting connected with the earthquake felt at Gisborne”. There are no accounts of a tsunami reaching the coast in newspapers of the day. While earthquake faulting could cause such a disturbance, the earthquake’s occurrence is too early and almost certainly too small, although it may have acted as a trigger. A more plausible explanation is a small submarine landslide, or an expulsive gas emission.
The event is given a validity of 2, as it is possible that a small tsunami was generated, but the source was too small and too localised for the tsunami to reach land at an observable height. The event is primarily recorded in the database to document the occurrence of localised disturbances at sea which may have been caused by gas hydrate emission, the larger events of this sort having been identified as possible tsunami generators.","Between 20:00 and 21:00 in 1 December 1877, when the steamer SS Go Ahead, en route from Gisbore to Auckland, was off Open Bay [Waipiro Bay], and about 5 miles [8 km] from the land, the sea a short distance ahead of the vessel was observed to be ""one mass of seething foam, the disturbance travelling towards the vessel, with much greater rapidity than the speed the steamer was making. The vessels stern was immediately directed to clear the outer edge of the agitated water, and although the captain was successful in so doing, yet the influence was felt, and the steamer pitched violently until the agitation was outdistanced... The agitation was no doubt due to some volcanic disturbance of the sea bottom, as a slight shock of earthquake was felt in Gisborne on Friday evening. (Bay of Plenty Times 8 December 1877); ""After the arrival of the Pretty Jane to-day from Gisborne, it became known that she had been subject to a strange experience on Saturday evening, between eight and nine o’clock. She was then steaming for Auckland, and was about five miles seaward from East Cape, when the mate observed, some distance ahead, approaching the steamer’s bows, in a slanting direction, a strip of seething and excessively agitated water. Looking outwards, he saw a long streak of similarly agitated water. The belt of disturbed water was less than a quarter of a mile broad, and approached the steamer faster than she was steaming. There were no heavy waves, but the water appeared as if boiling in a cauldron. The steamer’s course was altered to avoid the agitated stream approaching, and just escaped it, but the vessel was then tossed and pitched about in a most wonderful manner, and the passengers aboard believed she was foundering. After a time the tossing ceased, and the steamer got into smooth water. The cause of the commotion is unknown, but it was probably some subterranean volcanic action. On Friday evening [Nov 30] or early on Saturday morning, a slight earthquake was felt at Gisborne, and whether the phenomena observed by those on board the Pretty Jane arose from the cause that produced the earthquake or no, no one on board is able to say.""

The Dispatch, which was safely moored to the wharf, had all her moorings broken away, except the head rope, snapping her 4 and a half inch hawser and two others, as if they had been made of straw. The waterman’s boats on the beach on both sides of the river were upset and stove, and some of them had sculls, rudders and everything floatable carried away. The wave must at the very least have been three feet in perpendicular height.”
As with the 1871 March and August events (q.v.), the occurrence of a single wave or bore in the absence of other effects in the same location of elsewhere is not usually a good indicator of a tsunami. It is relevant to note here that the August 1868 and the May 1877 tsunami from South America had a significant impact in New Zealand and following their occurrence, people were particularly observing the sea and more than usually sensitive to its behaviour. The flurry of “tidal wave” reports in the 3 years following these events may reflect this.
Given this is the third event of this sort on the West Coast in just a few years, explanations for such frequently occurring events, such as meteo-tsunami, or perhaps abnormal bar and tide conditions, might be more likely than tsunami generated by earthquakes or landslides.

The newspaper was searched for further references to the event up to September 19, but none were found.

Similarly, Lyttelton Times and The Press (Christchurch) (searched till Sep 11) mention no earthquake (as might occur if the earthquake were a Kermadec earthquake) or tsunami.
Despite the paucity of information, this event is almost certainly a tsunami, as the deposition of fish is a key tsunami indicator. Moreover, the description of a mild earthquake, not widely or strongly felt, followed by a tsunami suggests a similar event to the “tsunami earthquake” that occurred on 25 March 1947 UT (q.v.).
If the tsunami in 1880 occurred 30-40 minutes after the earthquake as in 1947, it would have occurred at mid-tide (as calculated by NIWA Tide Forecaster, http://www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides). A water elevation of 1.5-2 m, similar to the height attained in 1947, occurring at mid-tide, results in water levels 0.8-1.3 m above HW. These water levels are consistent with fish being deposited above high tide mark and with the lack of more damaging effects.

[April] about 4 pm. The first accompanied by an unusual rise in the tide, it being about low water at the time, the sea came in beyond the usual high water mark” (Wairarapa Daily 17 April 1882)
The Wairarapa Daily was searched without success for any further information until 19 Apr 1882. No other location reported feeling an earthquake nor experiencing a tsunami on this date. However, there was a strong earthquake causing some chimney damage in Taranaki a week previous, on 6 April, at the same time (note that this event is not in NZ National Earthquake Information Catalogue, which is incomplete in era for earthquakes with M<6.5), and there may be some confusion. Being on the west coast of the North Island, the earthquake could not have caused a tsunami at Glenburn on the East Coast. Further, the earthquake does not appear to have been large enough to cause seiching, nor strong enough on the Wairarapa coast to trigger a submarine landslide.
According to NIWA tide forecaster (http://www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides), high tide would have been about 18:30 on 13 Apr 1882, i.e. it was mid-tide, or mean sea-level, at 4 pm rather than low water as indicated in the account. However, it is possible that the water had receded prior to the observer observing the rise. From mean sea level to over high tide is about 1-1.2 m. Spring tides occurred 5-8 days later, that is, this is unlikely to cause confusion re the proper level of the tides.
On 6 April, when the Taranaki earthquake occurred, the time of low tide at Glenburn does not coincide with the observation either.
The possible recession followed by a rise is strongly indicative of a tsunami, of meteorological or geological origin, although no other waves are mentioned. However, it is difficult to find a credible source and so a validity of 2 is assigned.","According to a correspondent from Glenburn, Wairarapa, “two smart earthquakes were felt here on Thursday last the 13th inst.

It also caused atmospheric pressure disturbances, which seem to have excited water waves by transferring energy into the ocean, resulting in sea level disturbances being recorded on tide gauges at locations remote from the source, including South Georgia Island, Panama, France, England, Alaska, Hawaii and San Francisco. Due to the shadowing by continents and island groups, a direct tsunami could not have reached most of these locations. (NGDC Tsunami Database, April 2009)
Despite the tectonic origin the tsunami is best classified as a meteo-tsunami, or alternatively given the name, rissaga.
","The rissaga/meteo-tsunami induced by the catastrophic eruption/explosion of Krakatau in Indonesia, was observed at many locations in New Zealand. The mechanism is believed to be coupling of the atmospheric pressure disturbance with the ocean as the direct tsunami would not be significant in New Zealand. Many places around the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans reported sea level fluctuations that could not have been from the direct tsunami.
In New Zealand, the rissaga/meteo-tsunami was first noticed late in the evening of 28 August (at Mangonui, Lyttelton, and Port Chalmers) about 29-30 hours after the eruption took place. Many locations, however, did not notice any surges until the next morning (1883 August 29), when the surges probably reached their maximum at most places. Some places reported a renewal of surges or their largest surges on the afternoon of August 29. The places that were most affected by surges were those that those which have been strongly affected by tsunami from South America, i.e. mainly the eastern seaboard from Mangonui, in Northland to Port Chalmers, in the South Island. Napier and Invercargill, where nothing out of the ordinary was observed, are notable exceptions. There is no data for Wellington, or for the Chatham Islands. At least one place did not report any effects until the afternoon of August 30. Several places reported continuance of oscillations for more than 24 hours.
The onshore water heights above sea level at the time was mostly ≤ 1.2 m with two exceptions for which the water heights are less reliable. The locations where the waves were (reliably) more than 1 m are Mangonui, Warkworth (i.e. Mahurangi estuary), the upper reaches of Waitemata harbour, eastern side of the Coromandel Peninsula, Whangara (north of Gisborne), locations on Bank’s Peninsula, and Oamaru.
These are some of the largest effects recorded worldwide outside the zone not affected by the tsunami directly generated by the eruption/explosion.

It was probably centred south of Taupo settlement and very close to, or under Lake Taupo and was most strongly felt in Taupo (MM7-8), where all but five of the chimneys were reported as damaged and numerous aftershocks were felt. At that time Taupo was a village with a population of 70, two hotels and a store. The most substantial effect was extensive and conspicuous landsliding of pumice breccia cliffs south east of Taupo. Dust from landslides, some falling into the lake, was visible from Taupo, and they blocked the road in a long gorge near Hatepe, indicating an intensity of about MM7. This gorge became known locally as “earthquake gully” because of its susceptibility to earthquake slips. Fissures occurred in several locations, but it is uncertain if any of these represent surface fault rupture. (Extracted and abridged from Downes & Dowrick (2009))
A small wave, 0.6 m, was observed following a magnitude M~6 shallow earthquake on 18 August 1895. Given that earthquakes in the Taupo Volcanic Zone can be very shallow, and fault rupture has occurred in historical time from earthquakes with magnitudes as low as MW6.5 (e.g. 1987, Edgecumbe earthquake) and in swarms in which the largest magnitudes are low magnitude M5s (e.g. 1922 swarm), it is possible that earthquake was shallow enough to cause a small amount of deformation.

It also caused ground damage in the form of landslides, subsidence of bridge approaches, slumping and cracking of roads and river banks, and sand ejections at many locations throughout an area of about 6,000 km2 east of a line between Gladstone, Waipawa and Napier.
Seiches were generated by the earthquake in the Waipawa, Porangahau, Manawatu and Wanganui rivers, and in Lake Rotomahana. A large wave, possibly a tsunami, was seen at Mohaka.
Interpretation of the intensity data and descriptive accounts of the earthquake’s sequential effects on trees in the distant landscape show that the earthquake was probably centred near Cape Turnagain. The paucity of aftershocks suggests that the earthquake occurred either on the plate interface (at 16 km depth), or in the lower seismicity band or upper mantle of the subducting Pacific Plate (at about 40 km depth). (Downes, 2006)","Following the 1904 August 09 NZMT (August 08 UT) MS6.8 MW7.0-7.2 a large wave was observed at Mohaka by two people on the beach, who immediately left and did not record any effects the wave caused (Downes, 2006). There are no accounts of sea level disturbances elsewhere. Downes (2006) suggests that if the wave was a tsunami then its source was most likely the landslides at Cape Kidnappers rather than earthquake deformation or submarine landslides near the source. Downes (2006) notes also that the validity of the tsunami is in doubt, and hence a validity of 2 is assigned here.

Recently, it was not known to have affected New Zealand, albeit with minor sea level fluctuations.
Okal (1992) finds a lower magnitude than magnitudes found previously, which are listed in the NGDC Tsunami Database.","Sea level fluctuations with a greatest observed peak-to-trough height of about 0.7 m and periods of less than an hour were first noticed at Gisborne in the early morning on February 2, about 26 hours after the 1906 MW8.5 January 31 1535 UT February 01 0305 NZMT Ecuador earthquake. The fluctuations continued for at least 27 hours. No tidal disturbances appeared to have been noticed elsewhere, despite the reports from Gisborne being widely circulated. In Auckland newspapers, it was specifically noted that tidal disturbances similar to those at Gisborne were searched for and not observed.
The duration and character of the sea-level disturbances at Gisborne clearly indicate tsunami, and the most obvious source is the Ecuador earthquake, although the first observed waves were about 8-10 hours after the expected first arrivals. However, the first waves may have arrived during the night and for this reason, escaped notice. Alternatively, they may not have been large enough to be obvious. For example, if the early waves were little or no larger than the later waves, it is unlikely that inundation would have occurred even at the high tide during the night as HW was about 0.2 m below MHWS and the sea was calm. Further, it is not unusual for path effects to cause the first waves to be very small, possibly even negligible. Preliminary numerical modelling (Power, pers. comm.) suggested that Gisborne should be one of the most affected areas on the main islands of New Zealand.",see individual observations,,Not listed.,"Okal, E. 1992.

Other newspapers almost certainly have more extensive information, which may be held by GNS Science landslide science section.","On March 10 1910 a large debris flow landslide fell from the 300m high Hipaua cliffs behind the Maori village of Little Waihi, destroying the village and killing more than 50 people. According to Cooper (2002), the cliffs are part of the Tokaanu-Waihi-Hipaua geothermal area and overlook the south western tip of Lake Taupo from the lower slopes of the Kakaramea volcano. The Hipaua cliff face has developed along the eroded south-eastern edge of the Waihi Fault scarp.
The cliffs are known to have fallen previously in 1846 9q.v.), when the village was destroyed, and many killed including a prominent Maori chief. At that time, another landslide 10 years earlier, i.e. in 1836, prior to organised European settlement was mentioned.
Further description of the landslide location and contributing factors (fault scarp and hydrothermal activity) in past and likely future landslides can be found in Cooper (2002).","As the large landslide March 10 1910 that fell from 300 m cliffs into Lake Taupo destroying Little Waihi village in its path, entered the lake, it caused a 3 m high surge. The surge then swept to the “opposite” shore where some children, swept off their feet, were rescued with some difficulty by adults. Canoes and boats were washed away. The height of the surge on the opposite shore and its location are unknown, possibly as far away as Motutere, possibly more local to the village, noting that the shoreline of the lake may have changed since 1910. The height of the surge needs to be at least 0.5 metre to have caused the children problems, but probably no more than 1-1.5 m, otherwise there would have been greater impact.","On March 20,  hillside behind the Maori settlement of Waihi,  a mile [1.6 km] west of Tokaanu, on the shores of Lake Taupo,  began slipping, carrying whares, houses, and everything in its track 1.5 m [2.5 km] to the lake. The landslide spread out about 60 m into the lake in deep water. There was little warning, and one person was killed and others were injured by falling debris.  As the hill continued to slide, people left the village. The landslide was only a short distance from the location of another major landslide in March 1846, when the village of Te Rapa was overwhelmed, and all the inhabitants were killed except three. Further particulars of the landslide at Waihi show that the person killed was knocked down by a big boulder, and as he rose and attempted to run away the body of the landslip overwhelmed him. As the landslide entering Lake Taupo, caused a surge that rose 10 ft (3 m), which then swept to the opposite shore [location unknown], where some children were playing. The children were swept off their feet, but were rescued by adults with some difficulty. All boats and canoes on the lake were washed away. The slip started a thousand feet [300m] above the lake level, a mile and a half [2.5 km] from the shore. Fissures 200 ft [60 m] deep were caused, and mud 30ft [10 m] deep covered the road from Tokaanu to Waihi. (Evening Post,  22 March 1910; also in other papers)",,Not listed.,"Cooper, L. 2002.

Thirteen shops and hotels in Westport reported losses of crockery, bottles, etc totalling £335. There were rock falls in the western end of the Buller Gorge and from the cliffs at Cape Foulwind. (Downes & Dowrick, 2009)","Following a MS5.0 earthquake centred near Westport on 22 February 1913, exceptionally high tides/water levels were reported at several locations north and south of Westport, spanning a distance of more than 80 km. Campers on North Beach near Westport on supposedly safe ground had to move to avoid inundation, reportedly after the earthquake. At Ngakawau, 30 km north of the epicentre, the water levels were 0.9-1.5 m above “normal” (=average) high water springs. At Karamea, about 80 km to the north-east of Westport, the tide was said to be the highest known for several years. At Cape Foulwind, the sea was said to have receded immediately after the earthquake and the effects to the south of Cape Foulwind were said to be “quite marked” with no detail. A NZ Geological survey geologist inspecting the earthquake’s effects comments in a hand-written report: “An earthquake wave [i.e. a tsunami] is thus indicated.” However, only in the case of Westport is the timing of the high water levels given.
These effects are consistent with tsunami except that, given the magnitude of the earthquake and the apparently moderate effects near the epicentre, too much of the coast was affected. Morgan (1913) comments that it was the time of spring tides and the earthquake occurred about 2 hours after high tide. In fact, according to NIWA Tide Forecaster, high tide at Westport was at 11:32 NZST, only 1.5 hrs before the earthquake (Note that NZMT, 11.5 hrs ahead of GMT, was used in this era). Further, the height was only 0.03 m short the highest expected astronomical tide (1.85 m) and 0.36 m above MHWS (according to LINZ website www.hydro.linz.govt.nz/tides/stdport-info/tidal-levels/index.asp). Given this and the closeness in time of the earthquake and the exceptionally high tide, it is probable that some of the reported effects are due to the higher than average spring tides, and not tsunami. This is consistent with one newspaper account reporting that the tides were also high the next day. Further, one of the newspapers (Westport Times) questions whether or not the high water levels were associated with the earthquake.
Seiches were also caused in the Buller River, but these would have been caused by the earthquake rather than tsunami. Similarly, the effects on an offshore ship – as though grating over a submarine object – are typical of the effect of “shaking” at sea.
Although the earthquake was too small to cause significant deformation, it is possible that submarine slumping or coastal landslides — small falls were observed at Cape Foulwind for example — may have caused a small local tsunami, which would explain recession near Cape Foulwind and the need for campers to move at Westport. However, the high water levels observed at Karamea were almost certainly caused by very high spring tides, and not tsunami. At Ngakawau, the exceptional tides may account for the observations there, but a small tsunami (< 1 m) on top of the high tide cannot be excluded. Given the uncertainties, validity of 3 is assigned, consistent with. De Lange & Healy (1986).

Numerous landslides occurred in the epicentral region, and in one of these near Cape Runaway a shepherd was killed. Slips were especially numerous along the course of the Whangaparaoa River (south of Cape Runaway). Numerous fissures opened up along the dry riverbed and on the adjacent flats, and in some places earthquake fountains occurred. Earthquake fountains were also reported in the Wharekahika River.

As the result of a memorandum from the Marine Department to the Government Astronomer, tide gauge records were requested from main ports throughout New Zealand. Without written responses from these (copies of which are held in GNS Science files; tide gauge records are not part of these files), the occurrence of the tsunami was only noticed in a few locations e.g. Gisborne and Tolaga Bay. Oscillations on tides gauges were generally small or not seen at all, especially where the sea was rough (e.g. Lyttelton). The greatest effects seem to have occurred in the Chatham Islands (water levels reaching about 1m above normal tide level at the time), and at Whitianga where the sea rose to high water mark not long after low tide (i.e. a peak-to-trough ≤1.5 m).",see individual observations,,"Listed in Laing (1954), de Lange & Healy (1986) and Fraser (1998).

The main indicator that this intensity was reached was the fall of nearly all the chimneys, with some falling through roofs. The large collapse of the cliffs on the Hurunui River also suggests MM8. In addition, there were fissures and sand boils at Leithfield and Waikuku Beaches in the MM7 zone. The stone-built manse at Waikari was ruined and there also was considerable damage to the contents of buildings. (Downes & Dowrick, 2009)","The strong shaking during the 1922 December 25 MW6.4 earthquake centred near Motunau in the South Island caused liquefaction effects with sand-fountaining, fluid expulsion and fissuring at several nearby Canterbury beach locations, including Waikuku and Leithfield. These effects, and unusual seas at Castlecliff Beach, near Wanganui, were incorrectly attributed by Laing (1954) and subsequently, by de Lange & Healy (1986) and Fraser (1998), to tsunami. The “bumping” experienced by ships at and near Lyttelton is typical of earthquake “shaking” experienced at sea.
On the other hand, Coastal landsliding at Gore Bay near the epicentre of the earthquake may have caused small tsunami, but no surges or water level disturbances were observed nearby, possibly because the sea was reportedly rough at the time.

There are no large earthquakes recorded anywhere within the Pacific, including mainland NZ, within suitable time frames (the worldwide Milne seismic network, and the NZ network, would have recorded a significant earthquake) nor any tsunami recorded elsewhere in the Pacific or on the main islands of NZ. The source is therefore likely to be local, and the duration of the tsunami is consistent with this conclusion.
It is, however, difficult to find a source, meteorological or geological, that is compatible with the affected area. There is mention in the accounts of a landslide at Mangere Island. However, the island is small, and a landslide on it would seem to be too small and too distant a source for the widespread impact of the tsunami on Chatham Island (the largest island). There are three possibilities: that the landslide was more extensive beneath the sea than was visible on the island; that the landslide was caused by the tsunami rather than being the cause of it; or that the landslide was unrelated.
No earthquake is mentioned in the descriptive accounts from the Chatham Islands that have been found, but these are neither extensive nor exhaustive. The Poverty Bay newspaper reports an earthquake being felt at Napier on the same night, time unknown, but makes no mention of its being felt in Poverty Bay, or elsewhere in NZ.
","On 19 July 1924 starting at about 19:15 NZMT (possibly Chatham island time CIT (18:30 NZMT)), a series of waves variously said to be 3-6 m high or reaching up to 6 m above HWM, locally called a tidal wave, affected a number of locations on the Chatham Islands over a period of just over three hours. Those locations most affected were the settlements of Wharekauri, Kaingaroa and Owenga on north and eastern side of Chatham Island, and the settlement on Pitt Island. At Kaingaroa, the waves swept over 100 m inland, sweeping away a dam supplying fresh water, one trawler was smashed and another lost. Near Wharekauri, a bridge was badly damaged, fences washed away, and the water washed over Te Awanui island. Several boats were damaged at Owenga, a small hut was washed away and some machinery at the shell-crushing plant damaged. On Pitt Island, the wharf disappeared, two small boats swept up a stream, and beaches eroded of shells. Mangere Island was also affected and a large landslide occurred. There were no deaths or injuries, although one person was washed from his horse near Owenga, and deaths may have been prevented by people at Kaingaroa and Owenga hearing the roaring approach of the first wave and running inland. According to contemporary reports locations on the west coast were not affected. However, recollections written some 70 years later (Holmes, 1993; see transcriptions), which accurately record effects at Wharekauri, also record higher than expected water levels in the creek at Waitangi during the time locations on the east side of the island were affected. However, the account incorrectly attributes the source to South America.
Several accounts also relate the near-capsizing of the ship Tees en route to the Chatham Islands from Christchurch to the tsunami on the Chathams. However the damage to the Tees occurred two days after the tsunami, and was storm related.
Tide charts for Lyttelton on July 19 (held at National Archives, Christchurch) have been checked, but no disturbance is visible on the poor quality records.
The newspaper and other reports of this event give a very credible account of a tsunami affecting the Chatham Islands only. The sea level disturbances had a sudden onset with the arrival of the first wave heralded by roaring, effects over eastern and western coasts of the islands within a short time, the occurrence of a series of large waves followed by smaller waves and duration of several hours. The occurrence of a storm is not mentioned, and while the tide was high at the start of the waves and it was a spring tide (both of which are about correct, HW at 1920 CIT, acc. to NIWA Tide Forecaster (www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides)), a recollection (Holmes, 1993; see transcriptions) specifically states that the high level at Waitangi, 2 hours after high tide, was odd as the weather was fine at the time.",see individual observations,,"Not listed in de Lange & Healy (1986), Fraser (1998) under this date. They list the near-capsize of a ship on July 21 that was attributed in the newspapers at the time to a tsunami in the Chatham Islands supposedly on the same night. de Lange & Healy suggest a tsunami was unlikely to upset a ship at sea. Further accounts given here confirm that the near-capsize of the ship was caused by storm and was unrelated to the genuine tsunami that occurred in the Chatham Islands two days earlier, on July 19, of which de Lange & Healy were unaware.

However, no tsunami was observed on shore, although people may not have been close enough to the beach, which is wide, to observe a small (<1 m) surge.
This event is included in the database to document the occurrence of a submarine landslide/slump or a possible probable methane/gas hydrate expulsion, the largest of which are thought capable of causing a tsunami. Similar sea disturbances occurred in 1877 off the East Cape region (q.v).

To eliminate doubts about possible sources - meteorological or tectonic - a day-to-day check of the newspapers is probably warranted, but low priority.","See ""Tsunami impact/sea level disturbance in New Zealand summary"" column.","Sometime after the beginning of construction of the Tolaga Bay wharf, a long structure reaching hundreds of metres into Tolaga Bay, three large waves, referred to at the time as tidal waves, severely damaged the structure when just five piles had been driven and were in the process of being secured. The waves were noted to be of unusual size, their crests reaching to the deck level, which was 3.3 m above the high water springs mark. The waves were only noted to have damaged the wharf and nothing is noted of their effect on the nearby shore, or anywhere else along the coast.
No source is known for the large waves that damaged the wharf or the exact date on which the waves occurred, so association with distant/offshore meteorological conditions or with a local or distant earthquake is unknown. Locally, it was noted that there was a moderate easterly breeze, which only slightly roughened the sea. A large local earthquake can be excluded, and as the waves seem to have impacted at Tolaga Bay only and there are no events on the NGDC site that are large enough, a distance source can also be excluded. De Lange & Fraser (1999) suggest a similar source to the March and May 1947 tsunamis (q.v.), which de Lange (1997) proposed were caused by marl diapirism. De Lange & Moon (2004) have since proposed a landslide mechanism. However, the 1947 earthquakes have now been shown to exhibit many source and tsunami characteristics associated with ‘tsunami earthquakes’ (Downes et al., 2001; Doser & Webb, 2003).
Considering the possibility that the source of the waves in 1926-28 may be an earthquake, including mildly felt earthquakes like the 1947 events, the Poverty Bay Herald has been searched for a few days following known earthquakes in 1926-27, without finding any accounts of the damage to the wharf. However, the earthquake file is probably incomplete for this era. Although a day-to-day check of the newspapers is probably warranted, it is problematic that the waves that damaged the Tolaga Bay wharf do not seem to have impacted elsewhere on the coast, noting the March 1947 event was observed along 120 km of coastline and the May 1947 tsunami along 80 km of coastline. Given this, and until such time as more evidence of a tectonically generated tsunami can be found, a few rogue waves or a localised meteo-tsunami seem to be the most probable causes of the waves, although one would expect a longer series of waves in the latter case and greater impact on the nearby shore.
In contrast to Fraser (1998), who assigns a reliability of 1 (=certain tsunami) a validity of 2 (questionable, unlikely) following the NGDC classification is assigned.","""On one occasion considerable damage resulted from three large tidal waves which ran into the bay. Five piles had been driven and were then being secured when the approach of the waves was noticed. It was immediately apparent that they were of unusual size, although the waters of the bay had been only slightly roughened by a moderate easterly breeze. The Author was able to view the spectacle from the top of the pile plant. The waves had begun to break before the reached the frame and it was difficult to determine their exact height, but pile heads were submerged in green water so that the wave crests were running at least at deck-level which, as already stated, is 11 feet above high water of spring tides.
The impact, as the first wave struck the pile frame, was considerable. The five unsecured piles were fractured and the lower ends of the leaders of the pile frame and all loose timber were swept away. The gantry, although chained and wedged out into position, was pushed backwards and, from the Author’s precarious position on the platform, it appeared as though the whole frame was collapsing. Luckily the destructive force of the succeeding waves was less and little further damage resulted. The work of repairing plant and redriving piles after the damage, which was caused in a few minutes without much warning, occupied several weeks.

The maximum intensity of MM10, accompanied by extensive landslips and faulting, was experienced over a wide area, fortunately sparsely populated. Surface faulting on the White Creek Fault was documented at the time. At the Buller River, a 4.5 m high scarp crossed a previously unfaulted 18 ka terrace representing a vertical displacement of 3.0 m, up to the east.
The earthquake and its many after-shocks, some of which were strong, greatly damaged roads, bridges, buildings, and other structures in the district. Innumerable slips descended from cliffs and steep slopes. The area of most intense disturbance extended from Murchison north for 65 km to the mouth of the Karamea River. The greater part of this area was quite uninhabited, being densely wooded, mountainous, and difficult to access. In all seventeen persons lost their lives, most of them overwhelmed in landslides. (Extracted and abridged from Downes & Dowrick (2009))
According to Hancox et al. (1997), the total area affected by landsliding was about 7000 km2, and with the possible exception of the 1855 Wairarapa event this earthquake caused the most extensive catastrophic landsliding in a historical New Zealand earthquake. Although the earthquake was centred inland, the largest landslide occurred on the coast near Little Wanganui Head. The larger rotation slump (Little Wanganui Head) had an estimated size of 210 x 106 m3.","Following the 1929 June 16 MS7.8 MW7.3 Buller earthquake, a 2.5 m tsunami was detected at Karamea, 20 km north of the large rotational slumps near Little Wanganui Head and high water levels were also experienced at the lighthouse on Farewell Spit (de Lange & Healy, 1986). De Lange & Healy record that the presence of a tsunami was difficult to detect locally because of high seas due to a storm in the Tasman Sea. De Lange & Healy (1986) discounted the evidence from Hart (1931) that the tsunami was recorded in Sydney Harbour.
De Lange & Healy (1986) assign a high reliability (1=certain), which is retained as a validity of 4 (=definite), at least for the tsunami at Karamea. The high water levels at Cape Farewell, which is remote from the source, are probably due to storm surge and waves.",see individual observations,,"Listed in de Lange & Healy (1986), Fraser (1998), and in other catalogues, which are listed and evaluated by de Lange & Healy (1986).

The effects of the earthquake were greatest in the towns of Napier and Hastings, but other towns in Hawke's Bay also suffered major damage. The death toll has recently been reassessed at 261, with 121 in Napier and 97 in Hastings. The earthquake was followed by fires in the business areas of both Napier and Hastings, the fires becoming uncontrollable as the water pressure dwindled because of broken water mains.
The earthquake was felt throughout most of New Zealand except for those areas to the far south and the far north and was followed by many aftershocks, some of large magnitude, and scattered over much of the Hawke’s Bay Province. The maximum intensity was MM10, with extensive fissuring, slumping and landslides occurring over the much of Hawke’s Bay. The strongest such effects, described in technical detail by Hancox et al. (1997), were experienced within the inner isoseismals, i.e. at intensities  MM8.
Surface deformation accompanying the earthquake resulted in a >90 km long, 17 km wide asymmetric dome trending northeast and extending from southwest of Hastings to northeast of the Mohaka River mouth. Maximum uplift of 2.7 m occurred near the mouth of the Aropaoanui River close to the location of major aftershock activity, while maximum subsidence of 1 m was recorded at Hastings, to the southeast of the steeper, southeast-facing side of the dome. Observed surface faulting of about 15 km in length was confined to the south-western end of the dome where near surface rocks had sufficient strength and suitably oriented pre-existing fractures to accommodate slip. Elsewhere, the elastic nature of the rocks resulted in surface folding above a buried causative fault. Dislocation modelling of the uplift and source mechanism studies indicate the earthquake was in the upper plate with a predominantly strike-slip mechanism, not on the plate interface. (The above is extracted and abridged from the Atlas of Isoseismal Maps of New Zealand Earthquakes 2nd edition (Downes & Dowrick, 2009), which lists key references relevant to this event, including details of its felt effects, building damage, ground damage, source mechanism, dislocation modelling, uplift/subsidence, etc and references therein)
Marshall (1933) notes many small landslides and debris falls along the coastal cliffs north of Napier, and several large coastal landslides, the three largest of which were at: Old Man’s Bluff, the toe of which extended about 0.8 km out from the coast; a location 1.6 km northeast of the Waikare River, a smaller slide than that at Old Man’s Bluff; and another debris flow larger than the other two, 1.6 km south of the Mohaka River, with an estimated volume of 11-15 x 106 m3. Marshall considered at least two of these landslides capable of causing a localised tsunami, although he gives no indication that any was observed. Hancox et al.’s (1997) estimates of the volumes of the two largest landslides are: Old Man’s Bluff – 72 x 106 m3; Mohaka – 33 x106 m3.","The 1931 February 02 MS7.8 MW7.4-7.6 Hawke’s Bay earthquake, one of the largest earthquakes in New Zealand’s short historical record and responsible for causing extensive deformation (uplift and subsidence) of the Hawke Bay coastline and several large coastal landslides, caused a relatively small tsunami, except at Waikare Estuary, where a large landslide caused a 15+ m surge destroying a farm shed (de Lange & Healy, 1986).
No significant tsunami was noticeable along the ocean coast near Napier, nor at the Port of Napier, attributed to the outpouring of water from the Ahuriri Lagoon (Callaghan, 1933; Marshall, 1933). Marshall reported that water in the Ahuriri Lagoon (location not given) rose 0.6-0.3 m above normal tide level. However, this may be attributable to differential uplift across the Lagoon, and/or seiching. De Lange & Healy (1986) also found no compelling evidence of a tsunami along the Napier foreshore, despite Laing’s (1954) report a large wave along Marine Parade and a surge in the inner harbour/Ahururi Lagoon entrance. Considering Callaghan (1933) and Marshall (1933), Laing’s report must be considered erroneous.
Marshall’s (1933) report on the coastline from Clifton on the southern shore of Hawke Bay to east of Mohaka, which was examined for evidence of uplift as well as earthquake shaking and tsunami effects, notes very little evidence of tsunami, certainly he mentions no evidence of a large tsunami. The ridges and furrows on the gravel beaches caused by strong shaking were not noted to have been disturbed by waves. Although Marshall (1933) considered at least two of the three large landslides he described from Old Man’s Bluff to the Mohaka River capable of causing a localised tsunami, he gives is no indication that any specifically related to the landslides was observed.
Other reports indicate a 3 m surge at Wairoa (de Lange & Healy, 1986), a series of surges and recessions (1-2 m?) at Waikokopu (de Lange & Healy, 1986; Marshall, 1933) and several surges at Clifton (1-2 m?) (Parsons, pers. comm.).
De Lange & Healy (1986) discuss Hart’s (1931) evidence that a tsunami was recorded in Sydney, concluding that “Hart’s records must be considered unreliable”.
A validity of 4 is assigned to the tsunami, for which the generating mechanisms were deformation and/or coastal landslide, and possibly submarine slumping, although none is specifically mentioned.",see individual observations,,"Listed in de Lange & Healy (1986), Fraser (1998), and in other catalogues, which are listed and evaluated by de Lange & Healy (1986).

Water levels were not specified, although the event was said to be similar to that in 1939, when a maximum peak-trough of 0.66 m and zero-peak amplitude of 0.45 m were recorded. The 1931 tsunami seems to have been noticed at Westport only, possibly because of its having a tide-gauge. It is not known when the first arrival was in 1931, but the 1939 tsunami had the feature, important for management of future events, of the first detectable arrival being several hours later than the expected first arrival, which is calculated using the fastest path, i.e. a deep water path.
Numerical tsunami propagation modelling (Power, pers. comm..) indicates that the late arrival can be attributed to the shallow water along Lord Howe Rise acting as a wave guide and thereby concentrating the energy towards the West Coast, whereas little energy travels along the faster deep water path.","""A similar phenomena [as that on 1 May 1939 (q.v.)] was recorded on the same instrument on October 4, 1931 when, it will be recalled, a disturbance of like character took place at the same spot.""

Waveform modelling of the event suggests pure strike-slip motion along a near-vertical fault dipping to the south-east with a strike of 30º ± 10º and a shallow (8 ± 4 km) focal depth.
Landslides mostly occurred within the MM9 isoseismal, the biggest slip in the district occurring at McCardle's, 5 km south-west of Wairoa, where the sea-cliff 600 m long and 300 m wide slid seaward, leaving behind it a scar standing 150 m above sea-level. (Extracted and abridged from the Atlas of Isoseismal Maps of New Zealand Earthquakes 2nd edition (Downes & Dowrick, 2009))","According to Laing (1954) and de Lange & Healy (1986), a large wave reportedly occurred at Wairoa as a result of the 1932 September 16 MW6.9 Wairoa earthquake, but neither could find any verification of this, with the consequence that in de Lange & Healy (1986) gave the event a low reliability and suggested it may have been confused with the small tsunami after the 1931 February 3 earthquake.
The strike-slip source mechanism and inland location of the earthquake suggest that a tsunami generated by earthquake deformation is highly unlikely. However, the large landslide at McCardle’s, 5 km southwest of Wairoa, which is referred to in the source event summary and described in Ongley (1937) and Hancox et al. (1997), could well have caused a substantial surge locally, and hence the validity of this event is increased to 3 (= probable).","""Laing (1954) reports an unverified account of a large wave occurring at Wairoa following an earthquake.

The wave/s, which passed nearby to another cottage in which two people were sleeping, did not awaken them. The damage was attributed to one wave only probably occurring at high tide (which was just after midnight) or thereabouts, although the reason for assuming this was not recorded.
The waves occurred during one of the most damaging storms to strike New Zealand in the 20th century (Brenstrum, 1997) and at the same time as high spring tides at Kaikoura, which, according to NIWA Tide Forecaster, (http://www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides) are estimated to have been 0.07 m above MHWS. The storm crossed the North Island on 2 February, primarily affecting the North Island, but strong effects were also experienced on the northeast coast of the South Island. Hence, the conditions were conducive to the occurrence of storm surge, and storm waves. However, storm surge and storm waves alone would not be limited to a few waves and would affect a greater length of coastline over a longer time. As to why the damage at Goose Bay was attributed to one wave only rather than a series of storm waves is not known, but the strong pressure gradients associated with the storm may also have provided the right conditions for the occurrence of a few rogue waves or a meteo-tsunami, in which a short sequence of waves is possible.
Another explanation of the limited effect possibly lies in the occurrence of an offshore landslide. Just a few hundred metres offshore from Goose Bay is a submarine canyon, the extensive accumulated sediments at the top of which are considered capable of sliding into the canyon causing a large local tsunami at Goose Bay in particular (Walters et al. 2006). However, the coincidence of the inundation with severe weather conditions and high spring tide levels is too great to dismiss, and the inundation is attributed here to a meteo-tsunami or extreme storm waves and storm surge.","Following heavy rains and rough seas, a tidal wave broke in the vicinity of the Caretaker’s Cottage at Goose Bay on night of 2-3 February. A hut at the rear of the cottage was lifted for about a chain and smashed to pieces in the swamp. The contents were destroyed. Nearby, fences were levelled, and a crop of potatoes was uprooted. Large boulders were deposited ""a fair height above sea level"" in the back yard of the cottage . Another hut nearby was also struck by ""the wave"". The wave struck the car at its rear and shifted it 20 ft, with the handbrake engaged. Seaweed was found up to the top of the wheels of the car. The damage was apparently done by one wave only, probably at high tide, the exact time not being known by Mr and Mrs King, who were asleep at the time.

Buildings were damaged there and on Santa Isabel and Russell Islands. The tsunami that was generated flooded a number of villages, drowning 9 children and 3 adolescents. The maximum water height recorded occurred at Beaufort Bay, Guadalcanal, where it reached over 10 m. Other than at Gasmata in New Britain, the tsunami was not reported at locations distant from the source. (NGDC Tsunami Database, March 2009)
Until recently (~2006), the tsunami was not known to have been observed in New Zealand.","Following 1939 April 30 0255 UT 1425 NZMT MS8.1 South Solomon Islands earthquake and tsunami, the Harbourmaster at Westport reported that a series of waves was recorded on the Westport tide gauge for four hours from 1 am on 1939 May 1.The maximum peak-trough was ~0.65 m, zero-peak amplitude of 0.45 m.
Although the first arrival was some hours later than the expected first arrival, the account clearly describes a tsunami. Numerical modelling of the tsunami from the 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake has shown that little energy travels the fast deep water path, and that the shallow water path trapped by an oceanic ridge (Lord Howe Rise) produces the highest waves. The first detectable arrival of the tsunami in 2007 (q.v.) was also several hours later than the calculated first arrival. The late arrival in 1939 is therefore not anomalous, and in fact, seems to be a key feature of events arriving in New Zealand from this region.","The automatic tide-gauge, which was situated at the lower end of the crane wharf , was reported to have clearly recorded the tidal wave ""that was the most severe that had taken place in the history of the South Solomon Islands. The markings showed the agitated nature of the movement at the exact time the tidal wave was reported to have taken place and this effect continued between 1 am and 5 am on May 1. The instrument showed an 8 inch effect between normal and low water and 18 inches above, giving a total variation of 2 feet 2 inches.

The tsunami was recorded at many distant locations around the Pacific. The maximum height reached in Hawaii was over 11 m, while at Juan Fernandez Island, Chile, and in the Marquesas Islands, over 9 m heights were reached (NGDC, November 2008). The devastating effects in Hawaii provided the impetus for the development of the Pacific Tsunami Warning System and Center, at first for US territories but now with many members around the Pacific, including New Zealand.
The earthquake has been identified as a “tsunami earthquake”, a type of event that was first identified by Kanamori (1972) and characterised by a number of key features relating to the source (including slow rupture velocity, long source time duration, slow initiation, location close to the trench with slip and dip being compatible with slip on the plate interface), and to the large size of the tsunami in relation to the earthquake magnitude, as well as large discrepancies between the different magnitude measures because energy is released at the low frequencies. Tsunami earthquakes are often not strongly felt on land and because of this, pose a problem to warning authorities in the near-field (as people don’t feel a particularly strong earthquake), as well as in far-field because of the difficulty in forecasting wave heights from a non-standard source, which is generally not well understood.
Numerical tsunami propagation and source modelling has been used to better understand the strong “beaming” effect of the tsunami across the Pacific, which produced high wave heights across a narrow zone from the source towards the Marquesas Islands and South America. Fryer et al. (2004) suggest that no earthquake source can simultaneously explain the narrow beam of large waves in the far field and the rapid variation in near-source run-up, and propose a landslide source rather than purely tectonic source. On the other hand, Lopez & Okal (2006) maintain that the unusual earthquake source is sufficient to explain the beaming across the Pacific. They also reevaluate the moment magnitude using mantle waves, obtaining a mantle magnitude of Mm8.6.
Until recently (~2000), the tsunami was not known to have been observed in New Zealand.
","The 1946 April 01 1228 UT April 02 0028 NZST MS7.3 MW8.1 Mm8.6 earthquake, south of Unimak Islands in the Aleutians, which caused a devastating tsunami near-source and in Hawaii, as well as strong effects in the Marquesas Islands and South America was also experienced in New Zealand, albeit somewhat patchily. The greatest impact on the main islands was from Ngungaru, just north of Whangarei Harbour, to Mangonui, with water heights above sea level at the time reaching 1.2 m and causing minor damage to a bridge at Tutukaka. Great Barrier Island, Tolaga Bay and Stewart Island were also affected with inundation heights of about 1-1.2 m. Other than these locations the tsunami caused little effect and was little noticed by the public. Tide gauges at Bluff, Wellington, and Auckland reported minor fluctuations while on Dunedin, Oamaru, Nelson and Greymouth tide gauge records, the tsunami was not observable. A report of large waves, inundation of the shore and some damage at Tuapeka on the northern coast of Chatham Island is unconfirmed, but credible. Some damage was also caused at Perseverance Harbour on Campbell Island.",see individual observations,,"Effects at one location only, Campbell Island, listed in Fraser (1998).","Kanamori, H. 1972.

Gisborne Port authorities did not have tide gauge records when asked nearly 10 years ago. However, it may be worthwhile checking with LINZ or Port Authorities for Gisborne, Napier and Waitangi, Chatham Islands, records.
","The 1947 March 25 (UT) March 26 (NZST) earthquake was located about 60 km offshore from the coastline north of Gisborne and 10-15 km west of the Hikurangi Trough. Although described by some as severe and prolonged, the earthquake was not widely felt along the nearest coast and caused no damage. The maximum intensity of MM4 is considerably less than the expected intensity for its moment magnitude MW7.0-7.1 and surface wave magnitude MS7.2 and even somewhat low for its local magnitude ML5.9.
This earthquake's importance lies in the fact that it was followed by one of the largest locally generated tsunamis in NZ's historical record. Like the 1947 May 17 (UT) earthquake (q.v.), it has been identified as a “tsunami earthquake” (Downes et al. 2001; Doser & Webb, 2003).
Source parameters (strike, dip, rake, centroid depth) and moment magnitude have been determined by Doser & Webb (2003) waveform modelling studies, using the Downes et al. (2001) epicentre, are shown on the map. They comment that “the earthquake exhibits many characteristics associated with ‘tsunami earthquakes’ (e.g. Pelayo & Wiens 1992; Satake 1994), including a small intensity and local magnitude compared with MW and MS, epicentre location ~50 km [sic, this should be 15 km] from the trench (trough) axis, shallow focal depth, low dip angle, and long rupture time.”
Doser & Webb also considered the possibility that the seismograms were produced by a landslide or slumping event with a single-force mechanism, rather than a double couple, commenting that:
“the radiation pattern for a single-force oriented at 315º (normal to the strike of the bathymetry near the epicentre) is similar to that of a low-angle reverse fault oriented at 45º, making it difficult to distinguish between single-force and double-couple models using body wave-form data alone.
Hasegawa & Kanamori (1987) have interpreted the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake (MS ~7.2) as a submarine landslide with a source area of 37 500 km2. This event is similar in MS to the Poverty Bay event, but no evidence for a submarine landslide of this size has been found along this portion of the Hikurangi Margin, so we conclude that seismic radiation for the Poverty Bay event was from an earthquake source.”
Eiby (1982a, b) and de Lange (1997) proposed that the March tsunami was caused by marl diapirism. De Lange & Moon (2004) have since proposed a landslide mechanism for the March event. However, Power et al. (2008) use tsunami source and propagation modelling to demonstrate that by taking into account the unusual source and rupture properties of the March 1947 event, which affect the dimensions of the fault plane and the slip, i.e. slow rupture velocities, long duration times, and low rigidity, deformation caused by the earthquake alone is a feasible source for the observed tsunami.

Because “tsunami earthquakes” like the 1947 March and May (q.v.) earthquakes are often not strongly felt on land, they pose a problem to warning authorities in the near-field (as people don’t feel a particularly strong earthquake), as well as in far-field, because of the short response time and the difficulty in forecasting water heights from a non-standard source mechanism.","The 1947 March 25 2032 UT March 26 0832 NZST ML5.9 MS7.2 MW7.0-7.1 Offshore Poverty Bay, New Zealand, earthquake, identified as a “tsunami earthquake” (Downes et al. 2001. Doser & Webb, 2003), generated one of the largest tsunami in New Zealand’s historical record.
The tsunami was observed along 115 km of coastline from Mahia Peninsula to Tokomaru Bay, probably at Waitangi, and possibly at Tuapeka, in the Chatham Islands. A large part of the affected coastline was sparsely populated. The tsunami occurred less than half an hour before high tide (at Gisborne), which was about the level of mean high water spring (MHWS) tide, and hence its effects were at their maximum.
Several beachside cottages and buildings, as well as bridges, fences and roads were damaged at several locations from Waihau Beach (where two old bridges on the old coast road at Waihau Bay were swept away) to Te Mahanga. At Tatapouri Point, Pouawa and the south side of Turihaua Point, where the tsunami was most pronounced, large breaking waves said to be 10-13 m high, were observed offshore. These locations are marked by the presence along parts of the coast of coastal rock platforms, covered at high tide, but visible at low tide, which would considerably affect the characteristics of the tsunami waves near shore.
At the northern end of Pouawa Beach, where seaweed was found 12 m above sea-level in telegraph wires well inland from the beach, and the decking and superstructure of a 16 m span wooden bridge across the Pouawa River was swept about 800m inland, indicate a water height at the maximum inundation limit of about 10 m. At the southern end of the beach, where the water height at the maximum inundation limit was possibly 6-8 m, three rooms of a 4-roomed cottage were demolished, and the building swept from its foundation. Five people in the cottage survived the tsunami, three trapped within the one room that remained intact, and two by running inland when the first wave was observed. Buildings at Tatapouri and Te Mahanga were also structurally damaged, and water entered others at Makorori, Wainui Beach, and Kaiti Beach. Along the beach south of Te Mahanga, north and south of Young Nick’s Head, at Makorori, Tatapouri and Pouawa crops and/or fences were damaged. Gisborne harbour experienced three large surges, reaching a maximum of 1.5-1.8 m above sea level at the time, followed by other smaller surges, the latter causing the tides to ebb and flow every 8-10 minutes for about two hours. Three large bores and a number of smaller bores surged up the Turanganui River and its tributaries, but the water did not overtop the wharves nor did any damage along the river banks. Bores were also reported in other rivers between Young Nick’s Head and Tolaga Bay. Fish were reported washed ashore at Tatapouri and, in large quantities, along the beach between Te Mahanga and Mahia.
Several people observed the arrival of the first wave and none noted any effect that might suggest that the water retreated prior to the first large wave arriving. Hence the tsunami arrived with a leading elevation, or at most, a small depression. According to one observer (at Tatapouri), the retreat of the first wave reduced the impact of the second, but the second wave appeared to be larger when it formed out to sea, possibly because of the depression between. The first two waves at Tatapouri and Pouawa were reported as about 3-4 minutes apart, and water remained at a high level for about ten minutes after the second wave at Tatapouri.
Although accounts of the tsunami suggest arrival times ranging from 8.40am, that is, eight minutes after the earthquake, to 9.20am, other accounts more reliably indicate an arrival time about 9am or just after. Two men, who had felt the earthquake at Gisborne Post Office and then travelled north by car, reached Pouawa just before the wave hit there. They estimated the time as just before 9am, or about 25 minutes after the earthquake. The distance of about 20 km was covered in about 20-25 minutes, that is, at a speed of 48-60kph, which is entirely reasonable given the era. Their arriving five minutes after the earthquake is not. The Harbourmaster at Gisborne, who was responsible for tidal records, reports the time of arrival of the wave at Gisborne Harbour as 9.05am, and at Mahia, about 9am.
Some accounts also record the direction travelled by the wave. From the hill behind Tatapouri Point the wave appeared to come from a little south of east. The waves were also seen to break at Tatapouri Point and then progressively break on beaches to the south. Another observer saw the wave travel across Poverty Bay from Tauhine Point to Young Nick’s Head. From the road just north of Tatapouri Point, another observer watched the first wave come in, the second wave forming out in the bay and then surging across the bay to Turihaua Point (presumably following the course of the first wave). His description of the first wave seems to imply that the southern end of the beach was affected before the northern end.",see individual observations,"Newspaper photographs damage, as well as private collection photographs (held at Gisborne museum) of damage and second wave coming in to Tatapouri(?) available.

The earthquake was not widely felt and the maximum intensity of MM5 is considerably less than the expected intensity for its moment magnitude MW6.9-7.1 and surface magnitude MS7.2, but is consistent with its local magnitude ML 5.6. Like the March 25 (UT) earthquake (q.v.), this earthquake's importance lies in the fact that it has been identified as a “tsunami earthquake”.
Source parameters (strike, dip, rake, centroid depth) and moment magnitude have been determined by Doser & Webb (2003) waveform modelling studies, using the Downes et al. (2001) epicentre. ). Doser & Webb comment that: “both waveform modelling inversions give a low-angle mechanism, but differ in strike and rake…. The rupture time is long (>25 s) and hence the focal depth is poorly constrained. Our Mw is slightly lower than the MS estimate of 7.2. Again [i.e. like the March earthquake], the mechanism and focal depth of the earthquake suggest that it occurred on the plate interface…. The May 1947 earthquake also exhibits many features of a ‘tsunami’ earthquake: low ML (5.6) compared with MS (7.2) and MW (6.9-7.1), relatively shallow focal depth, long rupture time and low-angle fault plane.”
Eiby (1982a, b) and de Lange (1997) have proposed that the March, and by default the May, tsunami were caused by marl diapirism. De Lange & Moon (2004) have since proposed a landslide mechanism for the March event, and again by default, suggested the same mechanism for the May tsunami. However, Power et al. (2008) use tsunami source and propagation modelling to demonstrate that by taking into account the unusual source and rupture properties of the March 1947 event, which affect the dimensions of the fault plane and the slip, i.e. slow rupture velocities, long duration times, and low rigidity, deformation caused by the earthquake alone is a feasible source for the observed tsunami.

Nevertheless, its effects (damage, debris, and inland water penetration) were noticeable the next day from Wainui Beach, near Gisborne, to at least Tolaga Bay, and possibly as far as Tokomaru Bay, spanning 50-80 km of coastline. However, much of the coastline was sparsely inhabited.
The greatest damage and height reached above sea level at the time (~6 m) was at Waihau Beach, where logs piled ready to repair the bridge damaged in the tsunami two months previously were washed away. Here, the sea penetrated 400 m inland up a creek, further inland and to a higher level than in the March tsunami. Water swept 50 m inland at Tolaga Bay and the water height was estimated to be 1.8-2.4 m higher than in the March 26 event. Taking the tide level into account suggests the waves may have reached 4-5 m above sea level at the time.",see individual observations,,Listed in de Lange & Healy (1986) and Fraser (1998).

No tsunami was detectable at any of the ports. Given the insensitivity of the tide gauges of the era, small oscillations (amplitude ≤0.1 m, possibly) may have been missed. Note that <0.1 m is used in the database to indicate that tide-gauge records were searched at the time and that the tsunami was too small to be distinguishable.","No effect recorded on tidal records for Sept 9 at Lyttelton, Dunedin, Nelson, Greymouth, Auckland (Marine dept correspondence to Seismological Observatory Sep 28 1948.)",,"Not listed, not surprisingly as no tsunami was detected.",,,

The tsunami was widely observed around the Pacific, the NGDC Tsunami Database recording nearly 300 wave height measurements.","The tsunami from the 1952 November 4 1658 UT November 5 0458 NZST MS8.3 MW9.0 earthquake reached New Zealand shores late in the evening of November 5. The most affected areas were parts of Northland, Gisborne, Wellington, Greymouth and Lyttelton. However, the effects were mostly minor with the largest zero-to-peak measurements or water heights above sea-level at the time generally less than 1 m. At many places the tsunami seems to have been too small to be observable on tide gauges or by the casual observer. Severe weather conditions and flooding in South Canterbury and Southland would have prevented small effects being noticed there. The lack of observable effects in Napier, however, cannot be attributed to this. The tsunami was observed in several rivers and in estuaries, tearing nets in the Ashley River and throwing a dinghy on the rocks at Greymouth. One person was slightly injured at Matapouri when a 0.9 m surge hit the boat he was in.
A key feature of the data is the occurrence of unexpectedly strong effects at Greymouth, given the path through New Caledonia, Vanuatu etc. The largest waves seem to have occurred late in the series but the first waves arrived very shortly after the calculated first arrival. On the other hand, the first observed arrivals, and strongest effects, at Gisborne were well after the expected first arrivals, and the largest amplitude at Wellington was some 24 hours after the first arrival.

The earthquake shaking was strong enough to cause minor structural damage and hence capable of causing slumping of the Tongariro Delta, only a few kilometres from the epicentre. Hence the small wave could have been caused by such slumping, although surface deformation and faulting have been caused historically by very shallow earthquakes of similar and smaller magnitude, for example, in 1922 (Downes & Dowrick, 2009), at the northern end of Lake Taupo. However, no new displacements were observed.","Slight damage to chimneys … Officers of the NZ Geological Survey who visited the area [after the earthquake] reported that gas was “boiling” from the bed of Lake Taupo near the village of Waihi.

The series of large earthquakes that followed ravaged southern Chile and ruptured over a period of days a 1,000 km section of the fault (the plate interface), one of the longest ruptures ever reported. The mainshock generated a tsunami that was not only destructive along the coast of Chile, but also caused numerous casualties and extensive property damage in Hawaii and Japan, and was noticeable along the shorelines throughout the Pacific Ocean area. (NGDC Tsunami Database, May 2009)
The magnitude of the earthquake was underestimated at the time, primarily because the surface magnitude scale saturates at magnitudes greater than about 8, and the moment magnitude scale, which can determine the magnitude of earthquakes beyond this limit, was not introduced until the late 1970s. More recent calculations of the moment magnitudes are: MW9.4-9.6 (Pacheco & Sykes, 1992); MW9.5 (Barrientos & Ward, 1990).","Observations of the tsunami generated by the great 1960 May 22 1911 UT May 23 0711 NZST MW9.4-9.6 Chile earthquake were reported at more than 120 locations In New Zealand. The most affected locations occurred along the whole eastern seaboard of New Zealand from Cape Reinga to west of Bluff and to Stewart Island, but the tsunami was also observed at locations on the west coast of the North Island, notably as far as south as Ahipara in Northland, at Wanganui and Paremata but not at New Plymouth, Foxton or Himatangi Beach. Ion the western and north-western seaboard of the South Island, the tsunami was observed at Nelson, Motueka, as well as several West Coast towns.
The tsunami was also experienced on the Chatham Islands, and Campbell Island, where water heights above sea level at the time were from 3 m to over 5 m at locations only a few kilometres apart in Perseverance Harbour. In the Chatham Islands, heights of 1.8 m (Waitangi) to over 3.6 m (Pitt Island) were reported, with damage to a wharf on Pitt Island, but the heights are only known at a three locations.
In the North Island, heights of 2 m or more were reported from a few locations in Northland and Coromandel, from Tokomaru Bay to south of Gisborne, at Napier, Te Awanga and Clifton in Hawke’s Bay, and at Lake Ferry in Palliser Bay, with the greatest heights around Poverty Bay and northwards (3-4 m) and Napier, Clifton and Te Awanga (3-4.5 m). In the South Island, heights of 2 m or more were experienced at Wairau (2-2.5 m), Sumner area (3-3.6 m), around Banks Peninsula (max. 3.2-3.6 m, at Lyttelton) and possibly at Oamaru (estimated 1.5-2.1 m). On the West Coast, Hokitika reported a height of 0.9 m.
The first arrivals on the east coast were at night, and in general, only noticed where the larger waves occurred or where smaller waves arrived on top of high tide. The first arrivals that were unmistakeable were within a short time of predicted time.
As with the 1868 and 1877 tsunami, the largest waves at Lyttelton and Sumner occurred within 1.5-3 hrs of low tide. The time of the largest surges varied around the Peninsula, and some (e.g. Okains Bay) seem to have been closer to high tide, but the earlier waves at a lower tide level may not have reached significantly above high tide mark. Similarly the largest surges at Gisborne occurred closer to low tide than to high tide, although there were also large surges some hours later nearer high tide, whereas in Napier, the largest surges seem to have occurred at the later time i.e. within an hour or so of high tide.
The largest surges generally occurred within 12-15 hours after the first arrival, some within the first 2-4 hours. In the most affected areas, houses, roads sheds, and paddocks were inundated, bridges, fences, and sheds damaged, and stock killed.
De Lange & Healy (1986) record that the Earthquake and War Damage Commission (1961) recorded 69 claims for tsunami damage. Most were reported from Banks Peninsula and Napier, although damage claims extended from the mouth of the Catlins River in the South Island to Whangarei in the North Island. The value of the claims was not specified in the Earthquake and War Damage Commission report.
The absence of a Pacific-wide Tsunami Warning System at the time meant that the tsunami arrived without an official warning being issued, although some ports seem to have notified each other, and one person heard of the tsunami on short wave radio. Several days after the main event, another large earthquake occurred in Chile (possibly an event listed in ITDB/PAC (2004) M7.5 May 25 0834 UT), about which the Air Department in Wellington received a message suggesting that a tsunami could possibly reach New Zealand. This initiated the broadcast of a nationwide warning on radio. The warning resulted in the evacuation of many east coast towns. In other places, people ignored the warnings and went down to the sea to watch. The response to the warning is discussed in Johnston et al. (2008). Interestingly, many people interviewed about the 1960 tsunami remember the warning and evacuation and the fact that no tsunami occurred, and recall nothing of the significant effects of the main event a few days earlier.",see individual observations,,"Listed in Laing (1954), de Lange & Healy (1986) and Fraser (1998).

Noticeable effects, strong currents and surges, with elevations of up to 1 m were experienced in Lyttellton, a few other Banks Peninsula bays, and in the Waimakariri River, as well as isolated parts of Coromandel and Great Barrier Island. Picton was surprisingly strongly affected with minor flooding of the shoreline, which surrounded a house to 0.3 m depth and covered low jetties. This occurred twice, at high tide, 27 and 39 hours after the expected first arrival. Although it was the time of spring tides they were not exceptionally high and cannot account for the inundation However, the NIWA Tide Forecaster, which has been used here for hindcasting tide heights, may be inappropriate for calculating tides at a location far from the open sea.

De Lange & Healy (1986) suggest that a submarine landslide was possible but gave the occurrence of a tsunami a low reliability.
The low reliability is retained here as a validity of 1 (very doubtful, highly unlikely). As noted by de Lange & Healy (1986) unusual waves have been noted at this location previously (1856, q.v.). However, on that occasion, a greater length of coastline, including possibly Akaroa, experienced the waves. A few freak waves or meteo-tsunami are strong possibilities, although localised submarine slumping is also possible given the probable presence of nearby river sediments (see discussion, 1856 event).

Shortly after the earthquake a tsunami devastated the coast, especially near the villages at Sissano lagoon, where there were thousands of deaths as the tsunami swept over the narrow strand into the lagoon. Since the earthquake evidence gathered seems to indicate that the primary cause of so great a tsunami from a relatively small earthquake is the coseismic slumping of a large area of the seafloor immediately offshore from Sissano Lagoon. (International tsunami Information Center (ITIC), 1998-99)
In New Zealand, the tsunami has been tentatively identified on sea level recorders at Lyttelton and Sumner Head as a sudden, several-fold amplification in shelf waves at the expected time of arrival, which lasted for several oscillations only. A sudden drop in sea level of 0.4 m occurred at Timaru, which has also been tentatively suggested as a response to the arrival of the PNG tsunami. (Goring & Bell, 1998)
","On July 17 1998 weather was calm and settled in Canterbury, and shelf waves,  frequently present  along Pegasus Bay coastline of Canterbury, were ""as small as they ever get (50 mm)"". Prior to the time of arrival of the Papua New Guinea tsunami the shelf was essentially quiescent. ""At almost exactly the expected time of arrival [2045 UT] the shelf waves suddenly amplified several fold. After a few oscillations the shelf returned to its quiescent state."" Oscillations, which were interpreted as a resonant response of the to the tsunami arrival, were recorded at Lyttelton and Sumner Head sea level recorders. A sudden drop in sea level of 400 mm occurred at Timaru at 2020 UT, near the predicted time of arrival of the PNG tsunami.

It was later withdrawn when nearby sea-level records indicated that only a small tsunami had been generated. The earthquake occurred at 68 km deep (Global CMT Catalog, October 2008), and questions have been raised as to whether it was a plate interface event or a steep rupture in the subducting slab (i.e. beneath the interface) (for example, Beavan et al 2006; Heeszel et al. 2006).
Tsunami waves were distinguishable on some sea-level gauge records in New Zealand and there were two observations of small surges and recessions at Whangamata and in the Chatham Islands. The maximum wave height (i.e. peak-to-trough) only reached around 0.35 m. The greatest peak-to-trough measurements were observed at Kaingaroa-Chatham Island (0.35 m), , 0.25 m Gisborne (0.30 m) and Lyttelton and Moturiki Island-Mt Maunganui (0.25 m), and probably Timaru (0.3 m), Napier (0.2 m) and Marsden Point (0.15 m). Most other gauge sites experienced smaller waves that were <0.2 m (crest-to-trough) and barely distinguishable from background seiching or weather-related long waves. In many cases, the tsunami was obscured on Port tide gauges to a greater or lesser extent by long waves (infra-gravity or far-infragravity) produced by weather systems and swell.
The first arrival at Kaingaroa, 3.5 hours after the earthquake, is close to the predicted travel time. The first detectable arrivals recorded in the North and South Islands at Moturiki Island-Mt Maunganui (5.1 hours) Marsden Point (5.5 hours), Gisborne (6.0 hours), Otago Harbour Entrance and Lyttelton (~ 6 hours), Napier (~ 6.4 hours), Port Taranaki (~ 8 hours) and Timaru (~8-9 hrs) are all quite late compared to the predicted first arrivals, suggesting that the fast Kermadec Trench path carried little energy for these locations. It is sometimes difficult to pinpoint the initial arrival time in the sea-level record with such a small tsunami signal as from this event, and there needs to be an awareness that larger waves may occur several hours after an apparent small or non-arrival of a tsunami at the estimated first arrival time. For the Tonga event, the largest recorded wave at Gisborne (0.3 m) was the 4th distinguishable wave that arrived approximately 9 hours after earthquake and at Chathams it was the 3rd wave. While the first waves arrived at Lyttelton around 6 hrs after the earthquake, the peak was about 18 hrs after the earthquake.

A characteristic of the tsunami was the later than predicted arrival by about 2 hrs, at all locations, with the maximum heights some hours after that. This is attributed to the shallow Lord Howe and Norfolk Island Ridges acting as wave guides, with the deep water path carrying little energy. This feature is important to take account of in a tsunami warning situation and in deciding when to give the all-clear.","Sea-level recorder data was posted on the Tsunami Bulletin Board by R.

Although the mechanism was reverse (Global CMT Catalogue, May 2009) compatible with the generation of a tsunami, the event was 50 km deep and only a small tsunami, nowhere more that 15 cm higher than ambient sea level (including the Tonga Islands), was recorded on tide gauges around the Pacific.
In New Zealand, the tsunami was recorded on three stations of the new LINZ/GeoNet tsunami gauge network, at Lottin Point (near East Cape), at Napier and at Owenga, in the Chatham Islands, and at the PTWC site at Waitangi. The first arrival at Owenga was not long after the predicted time, but Napier and Lottin Point, the first arrivals were more than 2 hours late, suggesting that the Kermadec Ridge acted as a wave guide, concentrating energy along the shallow, and therefore slow, path of the Ridge.

This event is unlikely to be the result of a simple, tectonic earthquake. Interestingly, the moment tensor solution is highly isotropic, which would be typical of an explosive source. There are a number of theories that may explain why a tsunami was generated; A geothermal explosion, A large, sudden, upward movement on a circular fault, or an undetected submarine volcanic eruption although if this is the case one would expect to observe a pumice raft and an increase in SO2 emissions. This was not observed. In addition, there are no known volcanic vents near the source of the seismic waves, and the earthquake was not part of a sequence, which would be more typical for a volcanic eruption.
