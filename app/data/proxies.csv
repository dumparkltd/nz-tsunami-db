"1","Particle/grain sizes range from boulders (may be 750 m3 or larger) to fine mud. A tsunami will usually transport whatever size ranges are available – it is sediment source dependent","1"
"2","Sediments generally fine inland and upwards within the deposit, but can also have a coarsening upwards component associated with deposition from a traction carpet. Deposits generally rise in altitude and thin inland and can extend for several km inland and 10’s or 100’s of km alongshore","2"
"3","Each wave can form a distinct sedimentary unit and/or there may be laminated sub-units","3"
"4","Distinct lower and upper sub-units representing runup and backwash can sometimes be identified. This is unlike storm or anthropogenic deposits","4"
"5","Lower contact is usually unconformable or erosional","5"
"6","Can contain intraclasts (rip-up clasts) of reworked material","6"
"7","Sometimes associated with loading structures at base of deposit – and can be associated with liquifaction features on the ground surface caused by earthquake groundshaking","7"
"8","Micro-scale features can include micro-rip-up clasts, millimetre-scale banding, organic entrainment, fining-up sequences and erosive contacts that may be visible in thin section but not in field stratigraphy","8"
"9","Measurement of magnetic fabric (MF) combined with grain size analysis provides information on hydrodynamic conditions ‘typical’ during tsunami deposition. Essential when no sedimentary structures are visible. Magnetic properties of minerals (incl. magnetic susceptibility) provide information about depositional environment","9"
"10","Heavy mineral laminations often present but source-dependent. Normally near base of unit/sub-unit but not always. Composition and vertical distribution of heavy mineral assemblage may change from the bottom to top of the deposit (e.g. often more micas at the top)","10"
"11","Increases in elemental concentrations of sodium, sulphur, chlorine (palaeo-salinity indicators, including element ratios), calcium, strontium, magnesium (shell, shell hash and coral), titanium, zirconium (associated with heavy mineral laminae if present) occur in tsunami deposits relative to under- and overlying sediments. Indicates saltwater inundation, and/or high marine shell/coral content, and/or high energy environment (heavy minerals, source-dependent). Preservation issues to be considered in particular for salt (downward leaching), but uptake and preservation in wetlands/soils","11"
"12","Possible contamination by heavy metals and metalloids (source-dependent, inc. water depth source)","12"
"13","Geochemical (saltwater signature) and microfossil evidence often extends further inland than landward maximum extent of sedimentary deposit","13"
"14","Individual shells and shell-rich units are often present (shells are often articulated and can be water-worn). Often more intact shells as opposed to shell hash. A wide range of shell ages is indicative of greater reworking by a tsunami as opposed to storm or anthropogenic deposits. Small, fragile shells and shellfish can be found at or near the upper surface of more recent palaeo-tsunami deposits","14"
"15","Shell, wood and less dense debris often found ""rafted"" at or near top of sequence (increase in organic content determined by loss on ignition, and sometimes moisture content)","15"
"16","Often associated with buried vascular plant material and/or buried soil and/or skeletal (non-human) remains","16"
"17","Generally associated with an increase in abundance of marine to brackish diatoms – often a greater percentage of reworked terrestrial diatoms near the upper part of the deposit. Large number of broken valves often observed, reflecting turbulent flows. Variations in diatom affinities often indicative of source areas and magnitude of event","17"
"18","Marked changes in foraminifera (and other marine microfossils, such as dinoflagellates, nannoliths) assemblages occur. Deeper water species are introduced – this is unlikely in storm or anthropogenic deposits, and/or increase in foraminifera abundance and breakage of tests. Composition relates to source (near-shore vs. offshore). Foraminifera size tends to vary with grain size","18"
"19","Pollen concentrations are often lower (diluted) in the deposit because of the marine origin and/or include high percentage of coastal pollen (e.g. mangroves). Pollen changes above and below the deposit are often indicative of sustained environmental change, a critical ecological threshold has been crossed – e.g. infilling or shallowing of coastal wetland","19"
"20","Archaeological sites – a sediment layer separating, underlying or overlying anthropogenic deposits/occupation layers","20"
"21","Archaeological middens: changes in shellfish species/absence of expected species indicate sudden change in onshore and nearshore palaeo-environmental conditions","21"
"22","Archaeological structures show structural damage by water to buildings/ foundations at a site","22"
"23","Archaeological burial sites have been reworked, often recognisable as “culturally inappropriate” burials","23"
"24","Replication – coastal archaeological occupation layers and shell middens are often separated or extensively reworked at several sites along coastline giving a regional/national signal of inundation","24"
"25","Traditional Environmental Knowledge (oral traditions) from the locality/region","25"
"26","Acquired palaeo-geomorphology indicates tsunami inundation - a tsunami geomorphology is present that could include evidence of: i) uplift or subsidence/compaction of site/locality, ii) scour/erosion/reworking of sediments at site/locality – altered dune morphology, iii) sand sheet or other similar deposits such as gravel deposition/gravel pavements","26"
"27","Palaeo-geomorphology at the time of inundation indicates low likelihood of storm inundation","27"
"28","Known local or distant tsunamigenic sources can be postulated or identified","28"
"29","Known local and regional palaeo-environmental drivers indicate low likelihood of storm inundation","29"
"30","Replication – similar contemporaneous coastal deposits are found regionally giving a regional signal of inundation","30"
