Ground cracking, the seiching of coastal lakes, and liquefaction effects (sand fountaining and water expulsion) were common as far north as Wanganui. These effects, however common, are unlikely to cause flooding to 60 cm deep consistently over an extended area as described. Further, as a tsunami was observed as far as Waikawa Beach, it would not be unexpected that it was observable some distance further north. At the time thae main part of the tsunami from Cook Strait would be expected to arrive the tide was 2.5 hours past LW, i.e. near mean sea level.

Women and children, half clothed, were rushing to and for, wringing their hands, praying and crying, afraid to stay within their houses, and terrified at the sight of the encroaching tidal wave. Many immediately fled to the Terrace for fear of inundation, but soon returned upon finding that the sea had receded."" (Blake, 1909); ""[During the earthquake, near corner of Lambton Quay and Mulgrave Street, while running to the Terrace] I could hear the waves dashing on the beach ... About two o'clock on the morning after the shock, I went down to the beach and there found alarm and confusion prevailing amongst the inhabitants, and very considerable damage done to property, and that the waters of the harbour had risen from two to three feet higher than they had ever been known to do, and had flooded some of the houses on the low beach"" (Carter, 1866); "" The first thing we noticed [early in the morning after the shock] was the extreme lowness of the tide; the sand extended far beyond its usual limits, and then all at once it was covered again by the sea, this advancing and receding of the tide took place three times in twenty minutes, and eventually left the harbour raised about three feet. The Beach where all the shops are situated was a miserable picture, few houses uninjured whilst many were perfect wrecks, and the contents of many of the shops were floating about on the water or thrown up on the shore."" (Coote, 1855); ""The tide at the time of the first shock was high and immediately rose several feet and flooded the streets facing the sea [i.e. Lambton Quay] several feet deep; it then receded lower than it was ever before known to do and afterwards for eight hours kept ebbing and flowing every half hour.""

He was thrown to the ground, and while trying to rise the sea, carrying logs of wood and debris, rushed in, and lifted him off his feet…. The sea rushed into houses in Lambton Quay ""to add to the general consternation the sea poured over the road on Lambton-quay, and entered the buildings along the waterfront. (Fildes newspaper clippings, dates unknown); ""The tidal wave ... was very evident; thirty or 40 feet high in the straits, and Palliser bay; and even in the harbour 8 or 10 - flowing into houses across the road [Lambton Quay], some 20 or 30 yards above high water mark."" (Fox, 1855); Accompanying the first shock was "" a tidal Wave which washed into Several of the Stores on the Beach, fortunately the Mouth of our Harbour being too Small to admit its full force, or it most probably would have Swept all on the Beach as a deluge, but from this impediment it divided itself, the greatest force entering the Next or Porirua Harbour"" (Hort, 1855); During the first or grand shock the tide rose several feet and flooded the floors of the shops facing the sea - the water then receded to many yards lower tide than had ever been known before even during extraordinary Spring Tides - indeed during the whole night the tides kept ebbing and flowing every 25 or 30 minutes….The tide at the first shock was high and immediately rose several feet and flooded the street up to the houses facing the sea - it then went down and receded lower than it ever was before known to do and afterwards until the following morning kept ebbing and flowing every half hour…. (Jolliffe, 1855); The tidal level appears to have risen some seven or eight feet and consequently overflowed Lambton Quay. A portion of the brick sea wall now in course of erection was destroyed. It receded almost immediately and continued to ebb and flow at short intervals (from 20 min to ?) during the remainder of the night ebbing far beyond Low Water Springs mark but I believe not again flowing after the first severe shock beyond the High Water mark…. (Jones, 1855a); The tidal wave appears to have risen seven or eight feet and overflowed Lambton Quay, destroying some part of the brick sea wall now in course of erection; it receded almost immediately but continued to ebb and flow suddenly the remainder of the night; the Barquantine grounded four times; it recede by many yards beyond the low water springs mark. (Jones, 1855b); In town the waters of the harbour were thrown across Lambton Quay, and flooded all the shops along the waterfront, causing everyone to seek safety on the higher levels.

It continued with severity for more than a minute, the ship slewed broadside to the wind; we were then in 6 fathoms, so there was little doubt but that it was an earthquake.... Lieutenant Jones and myself immediately landed. We found the tide alternately ebbing and flowing…. But a more interesting and extraordinary phenomenon occurred (I say extraordinary, because no person appears to have observed it in the earthquake of 1848); for eight hours subsequent to the first and great shock, the tide approached and receded from the shore every 20 minutes, rising from eight to ten feet, and receding four feet lower than at spring tides. One ship, I heard, was aground at her anchorage four times. The ordinary tide seemed quite at a discount, for the following day (24 h) it scarcely rose at all…. We returned to the ship at 2 a.m., the tide having at that time receded about 4 feet lower than at ordinary spring tide."" (NZ Spectator and Cook’s Strait Guardian February 7 1855); ""I am inclined to believe that the upheaving which certainly did take place on the 23rd ult. was the work of that instant, and within the following 12 hours, when the sea was seen approaching and receding in such an extraordinary manner"" (NZ Spectator and Cook’s Strait Guardian February 24 1855);"" The tide rose about 4 feet above high water mark and where the beach is low the water was 1 foot high in some of the shops and then receded and rose every 10 or 15 minutes."" (Pilcher, 1855); ""the sea had arisen three times in a huge wave and dashed over the sea wall and up to the houses along the strand, finally receding to several feet below its original level"". (Smith, 1855); ""During the whole of the night and morning, the sea gently ebbed and flowed every quarter of an hour, flowing completely over our front garden, several times advancing as far as the sill of the front door and retreating to such a distance as to leave the piles of the five jetties near by, erected by Baron Alzdorf and Mr Charles Brown, so free of water that one could walk around the outermost of them dry shod, the water being some fifty feet away; while the vessels moored close to the shore lay on their sides high out of the water"" (Taine, 1855); ""Then came an immense tidal wave, rushing up to the then one sided street of Lambton Quay, and washing things out of the shops. A box of toilet soaps washed out of the only chemist (Mr Barraud), was picked up by my husband, then a lad. When it retreated the whole bay was left high and dry so to speak, as far as the Man of War anchorage for about 15 minutes - thousands of dead fish were piled up from Oriental Bay right round to Petone, but a lesser tidal wave swept them away and relieved the townspeople's fear of pestilence.""

At one of these times, sea receded to wreck of Montmorency leaving it high and dry, while a boat being piloted into the Iron Pot was washed inside the breast work and was almost without water round it for a time. (Hawke's Bay Herald 18 August 1868); [At Napier] From about midnight of August 14, the tide observed to rise and fall in a remarkable manner about every hour. Waves increased in force until 9 or 10 o’clock on August 15, when the rise and fall was about 5 feet, or fully equal to the ordinary tides; only it being ebb tide at the time, the water sunk much lower than usually the case. During August 16 this continued in a lesser degree, and has at length gradually subsided. (Extract from Hawkes Bay Times, August 17 in NZ Herald 20 August 1868); First rush occurred at 04:30 on 15 Aug, when water rose 2½ ft over the ordinary HWM in harbour, but as water near HWM no particular notice taken At about 10:00 at LW, water rushed in filling up Iron Pot in about 8-10 minutes to about 3 ft above HWS then receded with tremendous force leaving the harbour almost dry. Another rush at about 11:00 which was more rapid in its flood and ebb, rose in about 6 minutes and fell in same time. Water also rose and fell inside the Spit, and sea in the Roadstead appeared as if boiling without any appearance of a wave. At about 13:30 water came in again covering the wharf and flooding all around. It was much slower in its flood and ebb taking 15 minutes each way. After this the sea became more serene, and rose and fell with decreasing force until evening of 16th when normal tidal movement began to resume. (Tabuteau, 1868); At 10:00 Aug 15, tide rose higher and fell lower in 10 minutes in the Iron Pot than ever known. (Evening Post 15 August 1868, and many other newspapers); Heavy showers from S.E. all day. On 15 Aug, tide was flowing, when suddenly began to ebb rapidly and in 10 minutes was lower than ever known. Wreck of the Montmorency was seen high and dry. Five minutes afterwards the tide turned and flowed into the harbour again, filling it up many feet above HW. For remainder of 15th tide ebbed and flowed at intervals of 2-3 hours. People on the Spit were rather alarmed and merchants got their sugar, flour, etc., raised above the floors of their stores. On 16th: Tide in harbour continues to flow in and out about every two hours, but not as violently as on 15th. On 17th: Tide has resumed its proper times and seasons.

 Times and heights inTabuteau's account are at variance with newspapers, ie elsewhere greatest peak to trough heights recorded in most newspapers are at 07:30 (at low tide) and 16:30 and in some newspapers 10:00, whereas Tabuteau has greatest heights above expected sea levels at 04:30, 10 and 13:30. He also has the expected time for high tide as 04:30 when it was 01:14, and low tide at 10:00 when it should have been mid-tide, both too late by about 3 hours. However, it could just be that he observed the levels at this time and, for instance, at 10:00 sea level was at LWM when the surge occurred.Tabuteau's max zero to peak of 2.1 m at 10:00 implies are peak-to-trough of about twice this, whereas one newspaper suggest only 1.8 m. However, although not the usual interpretation, the account stating ""the rise and fall were greatest being ""probably not less than six feet"""" may actually mean a rise of 1.8 m above mean sea level followed by a fall to 1.8 m below mean sea level, which would be consistent with observations of sea levels far below usual LWM and with Tabuteau..

The water continued falling until 04:30, when the end of the breakwater was dry, where average LW depth usually 15 feet [4.6 m]. At 04:30, with a loud roar, a wave of about 8 ft in height rushed up the harbour with great velocity. At 04:50 water was within 3 feet of the railway level and 3 feet [0.9 m] above the highest HWS, having risen 25 ft perpendicular in twenty minutes. At about 05:00 water rapidly receded and at 06:00 the bottom was visible beyond the end of the Government jetty; at 07:15 water again rushed up in the form of a heavy ground swell, and rose rapidly to 16 feet, and immediately began to fall again. At 09:30 the inner end of the screw pile jetty was dry, when the water returned to HWS with even more velocity than at 07:00. Off in the stream, the water was very thick and discoloured, boiling up as it were from the bottom. At 10:15 the water rushed out for about ½ hour, and rose again shortly after 11:00 to 18 ft; throughout the remainder of the day the water rose and fell without any regularity, sometimes at the rate of 3 ft per hour. During whole of 16th, no regularity of the tide, water ebbed and flowed three times in 6 hrs; at 14:16, time of HW, there was 17 ½ feet [at screw pile jetty?], and after ebbing an hour, it rose again to about 17 ½ feet at 16:15. Weather calm and clear; water very thick, and continuing to boil up in large eddies. On 17th and 18th, tides still very irregular, flowing one foot higher, and ebbing one foot and a half lower than the usual springs. Wednesday 19th, nothing perceptible. (Gibson 1868); Report by night watchman at the railway: At 04:00 John Knox barque seen to be lying on side; captain was aroused and when he came on board, he noticed that the harbour from the wharf to Officer's Point was quite dry and all vessels and boats high and dry. After a few minutes, a noise resembling thunder or a strong wind from off Officer's Point, then an immense wave seen coming up harbour towards head of bay. In a few minutes water surged around vessels, dashing them against jetties, tearing them from different wharves, causing collisions between them, stranding them on mud flats, and breaking mooring ropes, and considerably damaging them during rise and following recession. At least six vessels damaged. [Ed. Note; considerable detail omitted here]. Tide kept rising and falling rapidly for some hours. At 06:00 tide was below LWM, 15 min later was above HW, causing “fearful” current. At 09:00, another roller came into the harbour, again catching boats some now stranded on mud flats; again tide rose and fell rapidly, sometimes 3 ft in 5 min; At 10:30 a pilot boat came in from Heads, stating that they had noticed nothing except a very high tide. Keeper from Quarantine station also noticed little except the tide at 06:00 was lower by a hundred yards than it had ever been. The watch on board a vessel [location?] heard three distinct noises like rushing wind in the hour previous to the wave coming in. The officer on board another vessel stated water commenced rushing out of harbour at 12 knots, leaving vessel on mud. At 04:00 vessel lurched and commenced going round like a top, as if in a whirlpool and it continued until 08:00."" The large buoy off Officer Point was carried into Dampier Bay. Report from Captain Jenkin's of John Knox, one of vessels damaged at Govt jetty: At 03:30 heard a great noise, ship went down on beam ends and lying with yard arms on wharf. Capt looked up harbour, and saw harbour dry as far as breakwater and a wave about 8 ft high. rolling in. Vessel thrown against wharf by wave, and its rebound and damaged. In 15-20 minutes, water was within 2 ft of top of wharf, and in less than half hour ship was dry again. Water ran in and out at intervals until 10:00, when another rush did further damage. Water continued disturbed in afternoonwith very strong current in and out of harbour. Jetty 300 ft long at head of bay swept away, and paddocks flooded. Details of tides etc: at 23.30 15 August, water half flood, remaining at this for some time; at 00:30, rose to usual HWM; at 01:00 fell back to half ebb; at 02:15, water was 18in higher than usual HWM; at 03:30, back to half-ebb; at 04:30 water was again at HWM; after this gradually water levels dropped; at 06:00, down to LWM, making three times high water in then next 6 hours; at 12:00, at HWM; at 13:00 water suddenly dropped 4 ft; at 14:15, water rose higher than HWM, covering the reef.

At about 4:30, strange sound, like a steamer coming in, and a 20 ft wave seen coming up the harbour. It struck the vessels at the wharf, knocking them about violently and doing considerable damage. It broke over the breakwater and suddenly raised water inside 6 ft, damaging several vessels and setting them adrift. Water almost immediately receded leaving one vessel high and dry at the Govt jetty. At one time the sea bed was visible from the point of the breakwater to the buoy moored in a southerly direction off the Govt jetty. Water then rose and fell at intervals but still increasing at each influx until 11:00. About 10:00 a “roller"" came up the harbour, the change in water depth [at Govt wharf?] was measured at 18 ft. Buoy with 4cwt anchor moved from near Officer's Point to Dampier Bay; vessels lying at anchor faced in all directions, indicating that the currents were not all flowing one way. Large quantity of fish floated on the water. Observations attempted but water levels too variable and there was a slight wash due to SW breeze. Fluctuations all day August 15. Flood tide higher than usual. At Lighthouse, sea still disturbed on August 16, rushing in whirlpools and very muddy. On August 17, fluctuation continued. At time of high water at 14.15 16 feet of water at Govt jetty, and two hours later it was 15.5 ft. At high water springs normally about 15 feet at the jetty.

It was followed by three others, with intervals of about a quarter of an hour between them, and of which the last was the highest. A fifth wave came about 8 o'clock, but it was not so high, nor was the rush of water so violent, as of those which entered the bay afterwards. Between 10 and 12 o'clock in the forenoon, another succession of waves, at intervals of fifteen to thirty minutes, were experienced. They were irregular, but were quite as high as those in the early morning. A very high wave rushed in about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, which Mr. Bishop considers to be the most formidable and highest of all, and which rose 6 feet above the highest spring tides; the altitude of the Government bridges above high-water mark offering the necessary data for that assertion.

About 01:00 on August 15, the first great wave rushed in force and terrific noise. This fortunately served as a premonitory warning, and without doubt prevented the loss of many lives. 10 minutes after the first, another wave more terrible than the first, and after a like interval, the third and last wave. Houses, pahs, and bush in proximity with the shore, were engulfed and carried away by the drawback; but in many instances, human lives were preserved almost by a miracle…. At Tupuangi, two European houses were demolished, and the Maori pa completely washed away. The Maori is lost nearly all their clothing, and from two to three hundred pounds in cash. Unfortunately they had disposed of their cattle, and every other available commodity, in order to raise a fund to pay their expenses to New Zealand; but all is gone, and they are destitute…. Without doubt Tupuangi and the west point of the island was most severely visited. Indeed confident were the Maoris of a general deluge, that, when driven from their pa, the whole body encamped on Maunganui, the most elevated spot on the island, about 700 feet above the sea level. (Hawke's Bay Herald 12 September 1868); Whole Maori pah and 2-3 white settler's houses entirely destroyed and carried into the sea. Sand and kelp were the only remains of the pah, drays were smashed, and a 7-8 cwt grindstone erected at the pah was hurled a ""considerable distance"". Mr Enjst's house was carried away and deposited in the bush. The inhabitants, mostly Maoris, were left destitute. The first wave came into their houses, and they instantly fled for higher ground. First wave followed shortly after by a second, and a third wave, which was the largest. All they possessed was carried away as water receded, the loss of everything being aided by an offshore wind. Maoris had already sold many cattle and horses in preparation for returning to mainland NZ. (Lyttelton Times 31 Aug 1868); Most severely felt in the north, with low-lying areas all along the coast being inundated, though fortunately most buildings escaped damage. At Tupuangi, a Maori settlement of 60 or 70 people living mainly on the east side of the point, many whares were washed away. West of the point (where the Himitangi was later wrecked) a Moriori drowned while trying to salvage a boat. At Te Raki the wave struck a small house, carrying the contents, including a box of sovereigns, out to sea. Some household effects were later recovered but there was no trace of the sovereigns. The damage at Tupuangi included severe erosion east of the point. A cemetery was badly affected and, as a precaution against further tidal waves, the remains of an early chief were removed and re-interred at Ngatikitiki.

The sea passed obliquely by, and was said to cause less damage because of this and because the house was more elevated than Hay's [at Te Raki] and surrounded by a stone wall. As a result, most household furniture was saved. A Maori named Makare was drowned at Teraikopakipa Point, trying to save Anderson's whaleboat, which had been washed away. “He was holding fast to the boat, when an unusual rush of water came in and carried him out. Being a good swimmer, the poor fellow contended fiercely with death, but, getting among the kelp, he sank at once. The body was found this morning about half a mile from the spot.” (Hawke's Bay Herald 12 September 1868) The Anderson family residing along the coast, 4 miles from Tupunga, had a narrow escape from their house. The manservant, hearing the wave around his hut, ran to tell the family to get out of the house. The next two waves took the house away.

George Selwood roused at the first wash; from beach watched whole of harbour and anchorage empty, then escaped with his family out a back window (by necessity) as second wave washed into the interior of his store destroying stock and counter. Waitangi accommodation house sustained serious damage, the massive stone chimney demolished, and the building lifted from its bearers. The Beamish house was also flooded and occupants fled. Auckland family house flooded and palings damaged. Mongute Hotel received no damage. The river between the two settlements became swollen to an inland sea, and a bridge across it washed away. Taylor's residence near river was flooded, and stock much damaged. A number of whaleboats were smashed and carried away. A wreck, previously deeply embedded in sand washed onto bank high and dry. (Hawke's Bay Herald 27 October 1868); Beamish's accommodation house (wood with iron roof) was lifted off its piles. Water entered several houses. One family escaped through a window, the water being knee deep in the house. Goods from stores and houses carried away in drawback and deposited on Waitangi beach.

Not entirely ceased yet. (Evening Post 15 August 1868, and other newspapers); During the forenoon, the water had risen many feet in a very short time, and the large boulders that line the shore, near the remains of the Oamaru jetty, were covered, a heavy surf at the time beating on the coast. The water rose within a few inches of flooding the narrow strip of land which separates the lagoon from the sea. The water fell as rapidly as it had risen, and in a very few minutes had gone down, as nearly as could be estimated, about 20 feet. Alternate risings and fallings succeeded each other so quickly, that in less than twenty minutes they were repeated five times. It is said that once, about day-break, the sea was lower than it ever been known before. A boat, to which the outer end of the line along which the surf-boats are drawn, was moored, and which at ordinary low water floats in 11 feet water, was left for a few minutes so completely dry that a man was able to walk out and pick up an anchor which had been dropped alongside some time ago. Not a breath of wind was blowing, yet the surf was heavier than usual, and broke upon the beach as furiously as if it had been blowing a strong gale.

No time was given. A tsunami could have been generated if the earthquake had been shallow enough to cause significant vertical seafloor deformation, or by a submarine landslide triggered by strong shaking. A tsunami from sources near Cape Turnagain would arrive at Mohaka about an hour after the earthquake. However, it is unlikely a landslide source near Cape Turnagain would cause a significant wave at Mohaka without causing a large tsunami locally, which was not reported. A more probable source of a tsunami at Mohaka, would be the large earthquake-induced coastal landslides from the cliffs at Cape Kidnappers. 
A report of a second possible tsunami appeared in the Wairoa Guardian two weeks after the mainshock. A heavy shock was reportedly felt at Mohaka on August 25 at 10.30 UT (2200 NZT) was ""followed immediately by the uprising of the sea"". This earthquake was not felt a short distance away in Wairoa nor reported elsewhere and hence its occurrence and that of an associated tsunami is doubtful. Some confusion with the August 8 shock, which occurred at almost the same time of day, cannot be discounted. 
A search for tidal records from Napier and Gisborne, which might confirm either tsunami, was not successful and the validity of the tsunamis remains in doubt.""

A party at the Hole-in-the-wall also noticed that the tide fell and rose again very sharply at about twelve o’clock.

There is a separate wave height entry for the latter, but the descriptive data are not separated as some comments apply to both locations.] Decking & superstructure of 36 yr old wooden truss bridge (54ft truss span and two 25ft stringer spans) was lifted bodily and deposited half mile up Pouawa River. The cottage occupied by the Halls at the southern end of Pouawa Beach, in which there were three people, was overwhelmed by first wave. Only one section of house was not demolished. It was moved 10 ft and twisted. The rest of the house was smashed and swept out to sea. Another two people escaped to the road above the cottage before the wave hit. At another location nearby, a man’s attention to the wave was drawn by noise and a child's comment. The level of water remained high for some time after the [first?] wave. (Gisborne Herald 26 March 1947); Telegraph poles in area well inland from the beach [which end of beach not stated] carried strands of debris in cross-arms and wires, taken as indications that waves reached at least 35 ft. Very little development or settlement in the area . Two men travelling by car from Gisborne were approaching Pouawa Bridge just before 9 am, noticed a huge swell developing in the bay and saw it break on the first shelf of rocks. They estimated the height as at least 40 ft above sea level, foam and spray being thrown higher as wave broke. They drove rapidly to higher ground beyond the bridge. The destruction of the bridge was also observed by shepherd on high ground. Earthquake felt severely by the people in the cottage (clock swinging only effect noted). Clock registered 8.40 am when wave was noticed as Mr Hall looked towards Tapuwai [note that many details here are inconsistent with Tunnicliffe account (q.v. below)]. The second wave arrived when water had receded enough for people still in the cottage to consider getting out. It was not as high as the first wave. The first wave washed the two people outside up onto the road. (Gisborne Herald 27 March 1947); Mr Hall saw a wave coming in when he looked out the door toward Tapuwai. Another person at the cottage estimated wave to be 15-20 ft. [Other details same as Gisborne Herald.] (Dominion 27 March 1947); A report from two people from Rotorua travelling by car from Gisborne stated that they reached the hill south of Pouawa at about 9 am, saw a huge swell, realised the danger when the wave hit the first rocks, where it appeared to be about 40 ft high. Foam and spray went higher. On the way back [from their destination] they found fish which had been thrown 30 ft above high tide level. At the Hall cottage, the water reached the eaves and the room the three people were in was turned completely round. The other four rooms and three sheds were demolished. (Daily Telegraph 27 March 1947); [The following recollections from one of the two people, the nephew, who were outside the Hall cottage when the first wave arrived were published in 1990. Details of who saw what differ from Hall statements in newspapers at the time.] The house was 6ft below road. The view from the door was north along beach, where ""approaching the shore and us, at breakneck speed and roaring like an express train was a wall of dirty coloured water towering a good 30 ft, boiling and curling as it picked up acres of beach sand on its way to engulf us within seconds."" Before they could do anything the wave washed over them sending the other person (Winkfield) who had been outside slightly closer to the sea, hurtling past. They were swept up onto the road, one thrown up against a 6 ft bank, while the other (the author) was caught on a fence under water, and then thrown up onto the road also where the water was a foot deep. A smaller wave hit him there. He saw the wave careering ""up the hills for many hundreds of yards. Smaller waves were still coming in from the sea. As the waves came in they met receding surges with much debris. At this stage the sheds were picked up in the swirl, the roof peak of the house bobbed out of the water. The boathouse was detached and shattered. By the time they pushed towards the house the water was 4 ft deep. People in house escaped to bank above road. The author’s estimation of height of the wave about 25ft. (Tunnicliffe 1990); Observations by Mr Bennett from EQC state that debris was thrown 40ft above MSL at Pouawa, but wave estimated to be only about 15 ft. Estimated greatest at Tatapouri, wave reported to have arrived at 9.07 am.

Mr Newman knew of no foul ground where the wave broke. He drove on and stopped jeep 50 yds up the road above theTatapouri Hotel (about 2.5-3km south from Turihaua) and saw crest of first big surge sweep in, rolling over sand dunes in front of hotel and enveloping lower part of building. Outhouses were lifted off foundations and disintegrated in swirl, and sucked out to sea. Fences and other moveable objects swept away. Hotel immersed up to windowsills. Looking towards Turihaua, Newman also saw the water sweep across the road to Turihaua, almost up to the level of the house, tearing out fences and washing over the gardens, the wave bringing back debris when it receded. Newman watched as a second wave 30-35ft high above normal HWM surged across the bay towards Turihaua Point (with Hall family and Pouawa Beach on the north side). First wave was ""a huge swell the crest of which broke upon the land. The second wave formed itself well out in the bay. Broken water showed the line of its approach to Turihaua Point"". The second wave swept high up the beaches and across the highway, which Mr N estimated was 20ft under water in some places at height of surge. Debris was left on the road.

The dredge ""A.C."" dragged her working moorings but the launch Takitimu took her in tow and she was berthed at No.6 wharf. On examination there seems to be no structural damage done to the harbour.

It was noted that this was the first time that such a meandering reading has been recorded on the instrument since its installation in about 1940. A fisherman, who was using a hand net in the Grey River between 10 and 11 o’clock am on 6 November shortly before the Rata sailed, reported that a three-foot wave in the river had lifted his rowing boat on to the rocks. It was followed by an 18-in wave. The Rata was ‘dumped” onto the bar by an extraordinary lift just as she sailed, but with her 14 ft draught did not hit heavily. The high water reading yesterday was 19 ft 5 in.

The effect was of a very high and very low tide at half-hourly intervals throughout the night of May 23/24, the water swirling like a large mill-race. Strong currents in the river. Water inundated up to 50 m beyond HWM at times. No serious damage done, with exception of one launch thrown up on the road, another thrown onshore. One launch was slightly damaged, and the telephone cable across the harbour was ripped out. Along the coast quantities of fish were lying on the highway. Much damage was done along the coastline and the beach was scoured. At 0900 May 24, conditions were still abnormal and the sea was still surging up and down the river. (Coromandel and Mercury Bay Gazette (Whitianga) 25 May 1960); Results of survey on damage caused by tsunami: Buffalo Beach badly scoured, the sand entirely removed in places, exposing patches of ballast rock left by the old sailing ships back in the kauri days. At other spots huge logs were deposited on the highway. Although many boats broke their moorings and others were carried out into the Bay with moorings still intact all were eventually recovered with little damage done. On May 24, line of debris was left up as far up as the old power house and at several other points. At times the water stood at high tide level one moment and a few minutes after had raced out to extreme low water mark. The normal ebb and flow, which covers a period of 12 hours, was completed time and again in a matter of minutes. So low was the water at times, that the remains of the wreck of the “Buffalo” and remains of the piles of the old kauri wharf were visible. Five missing dinghies were found out in the bay and several more among the mangroves well up the river. Ferry service across the river was suspended from May 24-26. Telephone communications across the river were disrupted owing to the break in the submarine cable caused by the dragging boat moorings. (Coromandel and Mercury Bay Gazette (Whitianga) Wednesday 1 June 1960); Waves on May 23-24 created huge cavities in the beach. The current on May 23 was so great that vessels with their engines steaming full speed ahead moved backwards. Every boat at the Whitianga anchorage broke their moorings in the heavy seas and the salvage vessel “Three Kings” worked throughout the night rescuing boats. The boats did not return to Whitianga until May 25. One bach on the Whitianga shoreline had its front smashed in by heavy waves and at the Blue Dolphin motor camp seas carried away timber and other building materials left on the side by a contractor. Buckets were washed away from cowsheds and six families at the northern end of Buffalo Beach were evacuated from their homes while others made hasty preparations for evacuation if the tidal forces became greater. One person almost drowned when tipped from dinghy. A fairly large rock, “snapper rock”, a favourite spot for fisherman just opposite the Whitianga Wharf disappeared. Big waves rolled in at about 1000 on May 24 and residents feared that another surge with such force would carry away the wharf. One of the huge tidal surges at Buffalo Beach unearthed the 120 years old wreck H.M.S. Buffalo yesterday. People rushed out to the wreck to search for relics but it was abandoned after about 20 minutes when the seas began to return. (Thames Star (Thames) 25 May 1960); A surge of up to 7 ft on morning of May 24. Other surges. Launches were alternately stranded and riding high at their moorings while others broke away but were recovered. (Bay of Plenty Times” May 24th, 1960); On May 24, boats broken away from moorings. No major damage, although rise was 6-8 ft above normal and 2-3 houses on beach front were flooded. (Bay of Plenty Times May 25 1960); 11 small craft swept out to sea, gardens and the airport hangar flooded, and fish left stranded on the shore road and in gardens. Sea surged through the narrow river entrance, swept over the road and flooded foreshore gardens. The aerodrome was flooded and water covered the wheels of aircraft in a hangar. Estimated that river ran out at 25 knots at one time.

He was aroused at 0415 May 24 by the sound of water against the side of his cottage near one of the boundaries of the camp, on the side facing the harbour board sheds. He transferred his wife and family to higher ground within the camp. The water was up to about the level of the veranda of his cottage and it also went through his store, also on the lower level. The water was also in the cookhouse in the camping grounds. It rose and fell fairly regularly. The proprietor said that the peak of the surging appeared to be past at about 0530 May 24. The camp was flooded by the sea and also by the effects by the surge running back into the Uawa River, which rose and fell sharply during the surge periods. At the rear of the motor camp was a small creek running out into the Uawa and water rushed up this creek as the sea swept up the Uawa. When he went to work cleaning out the cookhouse in the camp this morning, Mr. Clark found that … had penetrated the … of about a … as a layer … about two … harbour … said that when low water was reached, it was as low a tide as he had seen at Tolaga Bay. According to Captain Mander, there were surges at intervals of about a quarter of an hour from about 0400 May 24, with the sea pounding up on to the beach. By about 0900 May 24 surges were easing with the receding tide. “A protective wall, made up of large trees, on the harbour side of the wharf was broken up and trees and other debris were washed up on to the road near the harbour board sheds close to the camp, the sea coming up with a rush. The surge rushed up a creek almost two miles from Tolaga Bay and flooded an orchard, dog kennels becoming awash and the dogs forced to swim until the surge receded.

No damage was reported, other than the loss of one or two light craft swept from moorings in the rivers. Disturbances first noted in rivers at about 2030 May 23, when a 4ft bore raced up the Waimata and Taruheru Rivers with a roar. Bore described as a wall of water sweeping swiftly past, capped with foam and tossing on its crest quantities of light driftwood. The noise resembled that produced by a heavy wind squall in trees. According to one observer, the first bore was followed upstream by a swell which raised the level of river by about 5 ft. Within 15 mins the inrush of water ceased, and by 2100, the water in the river receded to below the level prior to the first bore, baring mudflats. The outflow the river was carrying a good deal of driftwood, including some heavy logs, picked up from the banks. Surges continued at approximately half-hour intervals until daylight May 24 reducing in violence. The height the water reached was evident in deposits of silt and small timber along the lower slope of the esplanades adjacent to the junction of the Waimata and Taruheru Rivers. Disturbances were more obvious in the Taruheru River than in the Waimata River. The outflow in the Taruheru was extremely fast, resembling past floods. Silt-banks in the channel in the Taruheru were heavily scoured. Similar effects occurred in the diversion cut. [Photo caption] Water poured into the shed on the fishermen’s wharf in the harbour basin, reaching a height level with the lock on the door. (Gisborne Herald Tuesday 24 May 1960) Thirty-six hours after the first effects, rivers in the Gisborne district still pulsed on morning of May 25. Rivers were heavily charged with silt. Far beyond the normal range of tidal flow, the banks of rivers and streams displayed depth-marks at unusual levels, and their beds were scoured, revealing timber and other debris long hidden from sight, but no serious bank-scouring or damage affecting the district’s communications and river-control works occurred. There was no damage to riverside property or to approaches to bridges over on the Tauheru River. Many light structures such as jetties and boatways, projecting into the river, survived the surges without damage. Others had suffered to some extent, and some riverside homes had lost jetties which floated away from insecure moorings. The effects were not considered significant compared to past floods.

(Gisborne Herald Tuesday 24 May 1960); Watched by large crowds of people on the evening of May 24, water levels reached their highest in the Gisborne harbour since the surging in the Turanganui River and the harbour basin began on May 23. Although the water was above bank level at some points it did not reach the level of the wharf and the roadway skirting the Kaiti basin. When the peak was reached, the water was about 15 in. from the top of the wharf. Apart from fishing vessels which had been moved from their own wharf to berthages at the main wharves, there was no shipping in the basin at the peak tide. Late on May 24 people travelling over bridges spanning the Taruheru River heard hear a roar from the receding water. The Turanganui river looked to be well up at 0800 May 25, but later in the morning it appeared to be back to normal. The underground conveyors used in bringing frozen meat from low level chambers up to the lighters at the Gisborne Refrigerating Company were immobilised by the surging waters. Electric motors driving the conveyors were saturated and gratings were clogged with debris. Some departments at the freezing works were immobilised when suction pumps drawing water from the river, sluicing equipment and other equipment were put out of action. At high tide on evening of May 24 water level was 2 ft above normal, remained at its peak for about 20 minutes, and then surged quickly seawards again. At about 1715 May 24 there was some evidence of spill-over in the Taruheru river on to low-lying riverside sections. Water was only about 1ft. from deck level of the Botanical Gardens footbridge. Water swept into the premises of J. Wattie Canneries, Limited, near the junction of the Waikanae Creek and the Turanganui River, but only floor level was reached and there was no interruption to production. At 1730 May 24 a small footbridge over the Waikanae Stream, near the factory, was under water. (Gisborne Herald Tuesday 25 May 1960) At 2000 May 23, 1960, a 3 foot bore was observed coming up the channel, and a similar bore again at 2200 During the night of May 23-24 the period of rise and fall was about 20 minutes.

442,76,77,,23/05/1960,24/05/1960,d,2,1960,May,23-24,Napier [default location: Port of Napier],-39.476,176.92,4,TRUE,1,,,"A series of surges, the largest at 02:15 May 24, swept into the Ahuriri channel and Scapa Flow boat harbour, creating havoc among the boatsheds and pleasure craft in the tidal basin and smashing a 50-yard gap in the 100-yard-long footbridge giving access to West Shore. The waves were said to build up before they boiled through into Scapa Flow boat harbour. The backwash wrenched dozens of small craft from moorings and swept them down the channel and out to sea. After sweeping through the Scapa Flow boatshed compound of the Napier Sailing Club, the waves swirled against the embankment approach to the new west shore bridge, which was under construction. This was said to have turned the waves back and had a double effect on the boatsheds and pleasure craft. Some sheds, containing boats and gear, were lifted completely off their foundations and hurled against other sheds. Old boilers, tanks and power poles were flung against the buildings, while inside the sheds boats, gear, furniture, and other material was left in chaos. The waves smashed away a 50-yard section of the old wooden footbridge on the western side of the new traffic bridge under construction. The bridge carried the gas main and telephone cables to Westshore, and these were severed when the bridge section was carried away. The waves surged across the foot bridge several feet above the decking and swept on up the Ahuriri lagoon tidal channel spreading out into a vast lake. Gear from the pleasure craft, sections of the shattered footbridge, and even small dinghies, were carried far up the channel, some beyond the main Westshore traffic bridge a mile inland. In the Scapa Flow boat harbour itself, pleasure launches dragged their moorings and craft were rammed against each other by the force of the water. Many owners of small craft went to the boating club’s grounds at daylight this morning to discover that their yachts and dinghies had been swept out to sea. High water marks on the boat sheds showed that the largest wave had swept through the area at some 10 to 15 feet above the normal high water mark. Not one boatshed in the area had escaped damage, and one building had been badly damaged when large drums of petrol had been hurled around inside as the waves swept through the building. Apart from some scraping against the breastwork, Napier’s fishing fleet trawlers berthed along West Quay were undamaged. The waves surged to within a couple of feet of the Meeanee Quay roadway at Westshore. Pleasure craft on the slipways on that side of the harbour were torn free and hurled high up on the beach. Fish were strewn all over the area, as well as on the decking of the old footbridge and the new traffic bridge. The Napier Sailing Club’s new rescue launch, swept away from the slipway, was located off the Bay View beach– badly holed. The open sea off Napier was lettered with floating objects early am May 24. Boats, oil drums, and wreckage bobbed several miles out to sea. First warning of a disturbance was received by the Napier Harbour Board from Gisborne where the disturbance prevented the departure of a ship. The first indication at Napier was a minor fluctuation of the tide about one foot shortly after midnight. The fluctuations increased from then on until there was a maximum fluctuation of 10 feet at 2.15 a.m. On the backwash the water level went to three feet below zero on the board’s tide gauge. The sea levels were the lowest and the highest ever recorded at Napier and at the lowest low water level the remains of long sunk fishing vessels and small craft were uncovered rocks probably never been seen before were visible. The surges appeared to be at about 10-minute intervals. The sea was rushing in and out through the Ahuriri channel at the bridge site like a river in full flood. Throughout the morning the surging was taking place and the outgoing water gouged a deep channel in the silted up old inner harbour area. Another surge at 05:00 May 24 was 6 ft high in the channel, causing a car and a shed, with a man on its roof, a small distance. At 01:15 on May 24, water struck a caravan, in which three people were asleep, in the Napier Sailing Club’s grounds at Scapa Flow, filling it to chest-deep in water. They had been awoken by a roar, and found water rushing past the caravan. Successive waves battered, lifted and turned the caravan. Between surges the group made their way to a nearby building (the Clubhouse) in waist deep water in the dark. Another surge arrived as they got to the clubhouse, and this lifted the building off its foundation. In one of the succeeding recessions, the group ran 50 m in water to an embankment against which water surged. (Daily Telegraph 24 May 1960; parts repeated in Central Hawke’s Bay Press (Waipukurau) 24 May 1960); Surges of varying intensity were continuing on May 25.

This was the only part of Sumner and Redcliffs where the water came over the sea wall. An 18ft cabin cruiser moored off Beachville road, Redcliffs, was overturned and damaged by the first wave. At least five dinghies and a yacht came adrift at the Yacht Club, sweeping out at high speed over the bar as the waves receded. At Shag Rock the waves were about 12ft high, but because the tide was only half in at the time they did not reach the road. The water reached halfway up the window of the lifeboat shed there. The waves dashed against the sea wall at Sumner, but retreated without breaking over the top, leaving the beach covered in white scum. At Scarborough the water reached boats on the slips but did not disturb them. Half an hour after the first wave the water began to recede from the Estuary and in a few minutes it began to race past Shag Rock at a speed estimated at more than 10 knots. Residents of Beachville road said that at half tide, the height of the water in the Estuary was similar to full tide. [Note photos of water level changes in paper.] The sea crossed the main road at Moncks Bay and debris was deposited high on the foreshore. Resident at 6 Cliff street, Moncks Bay, estimated the rise in water level to be 17 feet. Early am May 24 tide rose and fell continually in swift fashion—about five feet in five minutes. At 0200 violent surges of water covered the road behind the boat shed and bigger surges to a depth of two feet could be seen on the far side of the main road near Cliff Street. Earlier in the night many of the smaller craft at the boatshed had been severely damaged. Between the Sumner lifeboat shed and Shag rock the incoming waves were producing spectacular crests and were beginning to slap across the road, accompanied by a steady roar. The worst effect occurred at 0239. when the water entered beachside gardens. At 0315 May 24, the Main Road, Bayview road, Wakatu Street and Cliff Street had extensive surface flooding. Several houses in Cliff Street were surrounded by water. The tide was still rising and falling rapidly. At 0300 water was flowing on to the south end of Rocking Horse road but did not reach houses. (The Press (Christchurch) 24 May 1960)(The Press (Christchurch) 24 May 1960); About 30 small yachts and dinghies from the Estuary and sheds and slipways in Lyttelton were swept to sea and damaged. A churning torrent of white-capped sea water raced up the Estuary at 15 miles an hour on afternoon of May 24, climaxing several hours of uncanny tidal phenomena. The peak at 1600, within eight inches of the top of the Redcliff’s sea wall protecting the Christchurch-Lyttelton highway, was below that of the high tide in the early hours of May 24. The water was above road surface on the seaward side but only a little seeped through into stormwater channels.

Although several small vessels grounded, no damage was apparent on evening of May 23 [up to 0350 May 23] The Harbour Board’s two tugs, the grab dredge Te Whaka a passenger launch, most of the trawlers, and some yachts were also aground. The water rose to deck level of Gladstone Pier, and covered the low level breastwork. It topped the caisson at the dock and spilled into the dock without however, disturbing the coastal vessel Parere, which is in dock. Because the water was reaching the electric mains under the wharves all power was switched off on the waterfront. Ships at the wharves, all of moderate draft, did not touch the bottom. The ship Persie (13,000 tons) which arrived was ordered to sea by the harbourmaster about 2300 May 23 as a precaution. Inspection during night of May 23/24 indicated there was no serious damage to new harbour works. At 0245 May 24. an hour before predicted high tide, the surging tides had lessened to a considerable degree. . (The Press (Christchurch) 24 May 1960); At 1600 May 24, 17 hrs after first waves, another surge swept in pouring into the graving dock and sweeping over the lower breastwork beyond No. 7 wharf. It was the eighth rise and fall of the tide beyond normal spring limits since 2200 May 23, and was only 2.5 in lower than the first onrush. Although little damage was done to the eastern harbour extensions or to shipping, the efficiency of the port was reportedly seriously impaired, with water damage to the capstans on the wharves. Between the time an overseas ship was piloted into the inner harbour and reached No. 7 wharf west an hour before high tide the tide dropped 10 ft, grounding the ship at the stern for a minute or two. More than 30 small yachts and dinghies from Lyttelton, Charteris Bay and the Estuary were recovered—many of them badly damaged—during the day by trawlers and Harbour Board vessels. Between 2200 May 23 and 1600 May 24 many violent and rapid changes of tide levels were recorded. At 2245 May 23 the tide was so low that the bed of the inner harbour close to the Banks Peninsula Cruising Club’s house was exposed between “Rotten Row”. At the lowest tide on May 23 all the trawlers at the breastwork were aground, but as the tide rose the skippers and crews took them away from the wharf and all night drifted in and out with the tide in the inner harbour keeping close to the tug Lyttelton. High and low waters were recorded in the harbour every two hours. At 1200 on May 24, the water was dead low in the harbour, and 30 minutes before at the predicted high tide at 1550, the tide was again dead low. Trawlers left the wharf to avoid grounding. At 1600, a surge resulted in the fishing wharf being under water to a depth of nearly three feet in a few minutes. The lockers of members of the cruising club on the ground floor of the clubhouse were again flooded. Surges put winches on the slipway of J. Miller and Company near the dock out of action twice. Forty five of the 54 capstans, which were used for hauling railway trucks along the wharf and were located three feet below the wharf decking, were water-damaged. Some were fully under water and others were immersed to a depth of six inches. Water entered the graving dock twice within 17 hours, and a vessel was in danger of refloating, the level on the night of May 23 being 2.5 in higher than that soon after 1600 on May 24.By night of May 24, waters of the harbour were more settled. The low tide was lower than usual, but all vessels were off the bottom. Two hours later the tide was making its regular rise. Watches were kept on the waterfront by harbour board employees and most trawlers were manned in readiness for any further emergency. About 30 small yachts and dinghies from the Estuary and sheds and slipways in Lyttelton were swept to sea and damaged. (The Press (Christchurch) 25 May 1960); Although still erratic water levels at Lyttelton on May 25 were not so high or low as on May 23 and May 24, and shipping was able to enter the port. The two earliest arrivals met with some difficulty from the set of the current at the entrance to the moles. At 0500 May 25., the tide rose one foot in two minutes to a height of 5ft 3in above normal low water mark. By 0518 the tide was at normal high water level and it crept erratically up to a mark 2ft 8in above normal high, only to drop six inches in the next two minutes. (The Press (Christchurch) Thursday 26 May 1960);Water levels were still erratic on May 26. Just after 1510, the tide began an unusual flow. In half an hour, it rose five feet and then began to drop more slowly that it had risen. The peak was far below the two freakish high levels of May 24 and May 25. It was four feet below the level of the decking of the main wharves. [Note that this was after a warning had been issued of a second tsunami arriving from a major aftershock in Chile] (The Press (Christchurch) 27 May 1960); Tides at Lyttelton on May 27 were almost normal, for the first time since the night of May 23/24.

Early am May 24 farmers attempted to evacuate sheep on to dry land 
Mud and water was reported to have entered the Teddington Hotel, as well as possibly and some houses in the vicinity. (The Press (Christchurch) 24 May 1960); The ground floor of the Wheatsheaf Hotel was flooded to a depth of three feet, furniture was floated, and the surrounding land and hotel were covered in silt. The hotel was inundated at least twice. Nearby, a cottage was also inundated during the night of May 23/24, resulting in badly damaged household contents. These were the only residences to receive damage. Repeated invasions of the tide during May 24 hampered the clean-up. With water covering it to a depth of four feet at the peak, the main road from Teddington to Charteris Bay was impassable for long periods on May 24. Several cars were trapped by the speed of the advancing tide, and some drivers had to wait more than two hours before they could take their cars through the shallow water. Some cars endeavoured to beat the tide to Teddington, but in three cases the drivers failed in the attempt and had to sit marooned while the water rose. When the tide rose high at 1610 May 24 eight vehicles were stranded on the road about three miles short of Teddington. In most cases the trouble is only water affecting the engine, but in some instances salt water is in the petrol tanks. (The Press (Christchurch) 25 May 1960); Most of the damage in the Peninsula bays on Lyttelton Harbour was concentrated at Teddington, where Mr M. J. Foley’s flat off the highway was inundated and an estimated 140 sheep drowned. A lot of the bodies were swept on to Mr W. G. Witte’s land adjoining. Mr Witte himself lost no sheep, his son, Mr Leon Witte, having moved them to higher ground the day before. The Wheatsheaf Hotel was flooded to a depth of 3ft, furniture floated about and floor coverings were ruined. Several cars were stuck on the road between Teddington and Charteris Bay.

There had been a minor surge earlier. Soon after 0230 May 24 water inundated a home 60 yds from the seafront and flooded the grounds to a depth of 5-6 feet and the house to a depth of more than 3 feet. The impact of the water forced the solidly-built old house of one and a half storeys backwards on its foundations for a distance of four inches. On the same property, a farm shed collapsed and the side of a woolshed was damaged. Extensive damage was done to furniture and appliances in the house. At another property, a small bach was lifted off its foundations and floated 110 yards inland. (The Press (Christchurch) 25 May 1960); Heaviest personal loser was Mr Orlan Gilbert, whose house stood close to the waterfront. At about 2300 May 23, there was a heavy surge in the creek, giving some cause for alarm, but it was not the four hours later that the real trouble arrived. A wave that might have been eight feet high struck the house square on, burst its way in and shifted the building back 4in on its foundations. As the wall of water rushed between the house and the farm buildings adjacent to the creek, a shed was ripped out and left lying in the creek, while one side of the woolshed collapsed. Farm gear was scattered far and wide. Not far from Mr Gilbert’s was a 24ft x 12ft three-roomed bach, owned by Mr E. Dickie, of Christchurch. It was floated off its foundations and deposited 110 yards upstream so gently that according to one resident of the bay, a glass could be seen still standing upright on a bench. Two boats were swept out to sea, others were deposited over the bay flat or stranded in fences. Piles disappeared from under the jetty shed, and the jetty itself was estimated to have been under about 2ft of water. Some damage was done to the main bridge. The road was not washed away, the wave apparently being concentrated in the west side of the bay. (Akaroa Mail 27 May 1960); first wave at about 22:30 rushed up creek and caused alarm, but wave at 02:30 much larger and did all the damge. A number of waves after first, in which water went out to base of wharf and returned to reach toes of observers [on waterfront? 1-1.5 m above HW?] House hit by wall of water at 02:30, left splashes 8 ft high in lounge, occupants up to knees in water, but house tilted from back to back by force of wave. Floorboards split as house settled on foundations with retreat of wave. Other cottage not tied to its foundation and shed transported inland. Fence destroyed.

The resident, who escaped in his night attire, was awakened by the roar of water about 0230 May 24 and at 0300, and in the darkness escaped to higher ground with water swirling all around him. His household effects were ruined and evidence showed that there had been a foot of water in the refrigerator. The bridge, a pile structure, crossing the stream on the road between Okains Bay and Chorlton, lost an entire set of piles while another three sets sank and allowed the centre of the bridge to drop by about 10 feet. One end of the decking tore away from the approach and canted three feet above road level. Telephone communications in the area were interrupted when the main cable supported by the bridge was severed. (The Press (Christchurch) 25 May 1960); Principal damage was to the Main Bridge, which was wrecked. One set of piles disappeared, others sagged and the centre of the bridge fell by about 10ft. One end of the structure was tilted up 3ft above the road level. Mr B. Bartrum, whose house is almost on the bank of the creek, awoke to find a foot of water in his bedroom. He got away in his night attire, and returned in the morning to find his possessions ruined. Mr W. Spurr, who lives nearby, had his house surrounded by water. A heavy bridge across the stream was turned out and dumped in a paddock some distance away. The school grounds were flooded by a depth of 8in to 9in, and fence posts were floated off.

The first surge came shortly after 03:00 and there was a rise and fall in the harbour level of 10 to 11 feet every two hours. Surges increased from 4-5 ft to 12 to 14 feet shortly after 0300. The biggest surge was between 04:00 and 05:00 May 24 with another big surge at 08:00 May 24. The surges were extremely erratic. The second big surge drained the harbour more than the first one, but did not come up so high. At first the surges were taking from half to three-quarters of an hour from high to low level, and vice versa. Later in the morning of May 24 they were more erratic and there was not such a great difference in height, but the variations were more frequent. A check on the rise and fall gauge from 22:00 May 23 was maintained and the recorded rise and fall was between 10 and 13 feet every two hours. The lowest point was 3 ft below the normal spring water level. The highest point reached by the water was about three feet from the embankment in front of the petrol installations. At its lowest level it was possible to walk out to the end of Holmes wharf. Water rushed out of the mouth of the harbour at a rate of about four or five knots. Police issued a warning to the harbourmaster at 02:00 on May 24, resulting in the entire fishing fleet, with one launch under tow, putting to sea within half an hour of the order from the harbourmaster. The fishermen did not notice any erratic movement of the sea when a few miles from the coast, and returned to port shortly after daybreak. No damage was caused to the installations in the port. (Oamaru Mail (Oamaru) 24 May 1960); Oamaru fisherman, put on the alert at 03:00 May 24, left for sea to avoid the possibility of damage from the tidal disturbances. The coaster Tawanui, berthed at the Oamaru wharf, was battered down and precautions were taken to provide for any serious surge. At its highest point the sea reached the top of the stone seawall in the harbour basin, but no damage was reported. The survey launch H.M.N.Z.S. Takapu stayed in the harbour, with the crew keeping a watch on the automatic tide gauge: surges of 7ft and 12ft, lasting up to 20 minutes, occurred at hourly intervals. At first they were small, beginning at 22:00 May 23, but gradually building up. A large surge would occur, and while at the high-level several smaller ones would come. The same thing happened when the water receded. The harbour master, Captain J. E. Hancox, said he had never seen the water in the harbour so low. It was rushing out of the mouth about four to five knots. The largest surge was between 04:00 and 05:00 May 24, and another big surge at 08:00. Eyewitnesses reported that there was a continuous swirling of water in the harbour entrance, although inside and outside the sea was like glass, with only a slight swell showing. (Otago Daily Times (Dunedin) 25 May 1960); Oamaru, NZ – Fluctuations in the tide level began at about 2100 May 23, 1960, increasing in range to over 1 foot until 22:05 when, after rising 2 feet, the level dropped over 5 feet in 30 minutes, remaining until 23:00, when it rose 6.5 feet in 10 minutes. These fluctuations of 3-9 feet for 10-20 minute periods continued for the next 30 hours.

The tidal disturbance was noticed up and down the Otago coast, but struck most severely in tidal estuaries of rivers and streams south of Dunedin. A warning to Taieri Mouth fishermen from Port Chalmers came too late. No one was about to gauge the extent of the freak tide, but estimates later placed the rise in the water at about 5ft. Many people were awakened by the roar created by the inrush of water across the bar and its loud hiss as it poured past the boatshed and jetty piles. Large launches bucked at their moorings, heavy ropes snapped, and dinghies either dragged from their anchorages or were picked up by the water surging along the banks and bobbed about on the current like corks. The deckhouse extending almost the entire length of the 35ft commercial pleasure craft Kiwaka was wrecked completely, as the launch was forced beneath the road bridge. A smaller fishing launch, the Matarua was dismasted. Its cabin was badly damaged when it struck the beams. Ropes were also snapped on other boats and about a dozen dinghies and other boats swept from mooring places. Some gardens were also flooded and water lapped against the sides of houses.

He cannot recall which day of the week it was specifically.
Jimmy was one of two staff on the dog shift between midnight and 8.00am. He was the shift engineer and his compatriot was Bob McGregor who acted as fireman, keeping the coal up to the boilers. 
The powerhouse needed a steady supply of water for operation of the steam turbines and they had two sources, both from the Ngakawau River about 100 metres away. The first drew water from the main flow from mid tide to high tide level (the river being tidal) and the other took water from the main channel mid river, once the tide dropped to mid-tide and below. The reason for this was to try and avoid getting sediment and leaves in the water-supply (even though they had screens). The two uptakes were about 7 feet (just over 2m) in vertical height apart, and both had pumps to send the water into the powerhouse.
On the night in question, early on in the shift (Jimmy thinks 2-3.00 am), the upper level pump (they called it the sump pump) was in action as the tide was in the high zone. So it was with some alarm that Jimmy suddenly noticed that the steam used from the boilers to drive the turbines, was exhausting to air. Normally the system operated in a vacuum and exhausting to air did not occur unless the sump pump was not working. 
Jimmy rushed down to the river to see what the story was and found that instead of it being high tide (and therefore the water being drawn in by the pump OK), the river was almost out of water altogether. The tide was OUT! Then while he was standing there watching it all started coming back in again, surging and welling up and up. However he couldn’t wait to see more of this strange activity as it was crucial to get the water back on and ensure the powerhouse kept operating. 
It was only later that that he put two and two together and realized that the strange ‘tidal’ behaviour was actually what was then called a tidal wave. (pers. comm. Mary Trayes June 25, 2010)","Despite it being 50 years on, Jimmy was an excellent witness with good recall (other than the exact date). At outset he said he would tell it as he observed and did this very clearly. At the end I asked him if had felt an earthquake at about the same time as the event he observed (thinking of the Mag 6.3 Fiordland EQ recorded at 2.46am on May 25th and which was felt in Dunedin, Gore, Haast and Greymouth as per Greymouth Evening Star accounts of May 25th and 26th). He said no, he had not. M Trayes then explained that there had been an earthquake at 2.46am on May 25th felt in many places in the lower South Island (epicentre later pinpointed off Big Bay) which was followed at 3.00am by a noticeable 3 foot high wave up the Grey River. As it seemed that Jimmy’s experience correlated well with the observations made about as wave up the river in the Greymouth, she was interested to hear too if he had felt the earthquake.

Mary Trayes comments that in hindsight this tsunami would not needed to have been great (maybe 1-2m) for it to have had this effect in an estuarine area like that of the Ngakawau River, particularly as it corresponded with a normal a high tide. Tsunami effects are compounded by embayments and estuaries and often a surge wave carries upriver at least as high as spring high tides do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24/05/1960 2:00,24/05/1960 3:00,t,2,02:00 - 03:00 (23 or 24 May),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,1,,23/05/1960 2:00,24/05/1960 3:00,t,2,02:00 - 03:00 (23 or 24/5/1960),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IV,IV,2,1,,,see source event,,see source event,see source event

(Marlborough Express 30 march 1964; briefer version in Oamaru Mail 30 March 1964)","According to NIWA Tide Forecaster (http://www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides)), HW was at 22:23 29 March NZST (0.73), and again at 10:34 30 March NZST( 0.78 ) at a User defined location near Picton. MHWS at Picton is 0.74 m and Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT) is 0.88 m above MSL (LINZ Website). While the tsunami impact was greatest within an hour of the MHWS level, the tide was not an exceptionally high spring tide and cannot account for the inundation. Assuming the houses are at least 0.3 m above HAT, inundation level must have been at least 0.8 m but probably no more than 1.5 m. Note that the highest level seems to have occurred 42 hours after generation and 27 hours after expected first arrival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29/03/1964 7:00,29/03/1964 7:00,t,1,,29/03/1964 20:00,29/03/1964 20:00,t,1,,,15.5,15.5,1,28.5,28.5,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.8,1.5,2,,30/03/1964 9:40,30/03/1964 9:40,t,1,9:40,,,,,50,50,1,,1.5,2.2,2,,30/03/1964 9:40,30/03/1964 9:40,t,1,9:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RRF,1,,,,,,V,V,,,,,see source event,,see source event,see source event

However, FIG waves tend to have periods of 6 to 20 min, so the very long waves in mid-morning of 4 May, may be the first tsunami waves. The large waves at high tide could be a superposition of FIG and tsunami waves. Marsden Point is in direct line with Tonga, so for the sites under consideration, the tsunami would be expected to reach here first. (www.mulgor.co.nz/TongaTsu06/); ""Derek Goring, of Mulgor Consulting, who monitors tide gauges at some NZ ports, has posted his analysis of the records for tsunami for 4-5 May on www.mulgor.co.nz/TongaTsu06/ Derek notes that he has excluded some where nothing apparently happened, and that in many cases, the tsunami was obscured to a greater or lesser extent by long waves (infra-gravity or far-infragravity) produced by weather systems and swell. 
The greatest peak-to-trough measurements were observed at Kaingaroa-Chatham Island (0.35 m), Gisborne (0.30 m) and Lyttelton (0.25 m), and probably Timaru (0.3 m), Napier (0.2 m) and Marsden Point (0.15 m)....
The first arrival at Kaingaroa, 3.5 hours after the earthquake, is consistent with William Power’s movie (see below). The first arrivals recorded in the North and South Islands were at Moturiki-Mt Maunganui (5.1 hours) Marsden Point (5.5 hours), Gisborne (6.0 hours), Otago Harbour Entrance and Lyttelton (~ 6 hours), Napier (~ 6.4 hours), Port Taranaki (~ 8 hours). The Timaru waves arrived quite late at 9 hrs after the earthquake. While the first waves arrived at Lyttelton around 6 hrs after the earthquake, the peak was at about 18 hrs after the earthquake – this very late peak is interesting and its cause probably requires investigation.

Two guides and 16 passengers were on two boats on the lake when the 6.3 magnitude Canterbury earthquake hit, triggering tsunamis and causing a massive ice calving off the glacier. Aoraki-Mt Cook Alpine Village Ltd general manager tourism Denis Callesen said the guides were radioed from the village as soon as the earthquake was felt, so were able to prepare for the event. Mr Callesen said the boats endured 30 minutes of tsunamis, up to 3.5 metres high. Staff are trained for the event, knowing to turn the boats towards each tsunami and motor gently forwards. About 30 million tonnes of ice calved – 1200 metres across the face, 30 metres above the lake and more than 250 metres below the surface to the bottom of the lake and back for about 75 metres. Mr Callesen said it was either the third biggest, or second-equal biggest event in Tasman Lake's history. http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/4692057/Earthquake-causes-glacier-to-calve",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22/02/2011 12:00,22/02/2011 12:00,t,1,,See source material,,,,,,,,,,3.5,3.5,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Around 2.00 pm, I noticed the river stopped flowing out towards the sea ( on the outgoing tide) and the water was actually flowing in as if the tide was coming in. It was clearly evident as debris in the river which had gone past the jetty downstream was now flowing back past the jetty upstream. We left before the surge upstream halted, so didn't observe the subsequent outflow. The Clevedon Cruising Club is probably 3 or 4 km upstream from the river mouth.

On Wednesday evening, the 6th February I was at the Mokihnui River mouth. Contrary to what the Harbour Master of Westport reported (that there was no sign at all of any raised sea levels due to the Solomon's tsunami), My frined and I saw evidence of tsunami conditions. I believe the Harbour Master was not very observant. What my friend and I saw were waves breaking much further out to sea than normally in such fine weather. There was wave agitation along the shore, with a lot of wave reflection. There were impressive surges and chaotic water at the river mouth, the sea was obviously in turmoil. About one kilometre up river, where it is still tidal, and the high tide was at about 20:10, at 21:20 the tide was still at peak. I went back to the same areas last night (the 7th) to confirm our findings. By 21:20 the tide was on the turn (wet sand above the water level), even though the tide was an hour and 8 minutes later. Also, the river mouth was a lot calmer, with no wave reflection on the adjacent beach, but a steady influx of well-spaced, well-formed waves. The river mouth was a lot calmer, with little surge. Waves were forming a lot closer to shore than the night before. (pers. comm.

Tauranga real estate salesman Grahame Lindsey was fishing with his kontiki at 5.30am on Saturday morning when he was rocked by a one metre high surge.
""It gave me the willies, it was quite scary,"" Mr Lindsey told the Bay of Plenty Times.
The surge at low tide swept up the beach to reach the high tide line, stayed for several minutes and then drained out in a big vacuum. It was up to the waist of a nearby surf caster and swept another fisherman off his feet.
""It was a hell of a volume of water. I have never seen anything like it, it was unbelievable.""
Mr Lindsey said it did not behave like a freak wave because of the way the way remained up the beach for so long.
There was so much force that several kontiki lines washed up parallel to the beach and broke his line on his winch.
However the Bay of Plenty's Civil Defence emergency management group controller Clinton Naude said nothing was detected by GNS Science that could have contributed to a tsunami hitting Tauranga's coastline.
What was described would have needed a magnitude six distant source and GNS Science registered nothing that could have contributed to it.
""We would have still have picked it up on seismograph earthquake monitoring, even if it was a close-in source.""
GNS Science have monitoring buoys that detect incoming tsunami and are linked to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre.
Mr Naude noted that some big swells were running in the weekend.
