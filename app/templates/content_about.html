                      Welcome to the development version of the new <strong>New Zealand Tsunami Database</strong>.
                      Here you will find information about tsunamis that have reached the coastline of New Zealand since humans arrived in this land until the present day.

                      The database is the work of historical seismologist Gaye Downes of GNS Science who collected reports of tsunamis around New Zealand and, in many cases, carried out research to determine parameters of the source, travel time and impact associated with each event. Reports of tsunamis that make up the core of this database come from tide gauges, newspaper articles, harbour masters, records from ships, personal diary entries and MƒÅori oral records. This primary source material is summarised in the database and complete transcriptions are held by the database custodian.

                      The purpose of creating a publicly available tsunami database is to increase awareness of New Zealand's tsunami hazard, provide evidence to inform coastal planning, enable calibration of tsunami modelling, hazard estimates and forecasting, and promote further research. New Zealand lies in the path of tsunamis generated from around the Pacific Rim (Figure 1) as well as from sources closer to home associated with the active Pacific-Australian Plate Boundary. In addition, this country has a long length of coastline in comparison to its land area and much of the population live near the coast. Therefore, learning about our tsunami hazard and how to mitigate risk is a high priority. Future plans for the online presentation of the database are outlined in FAQ.

                      The New Zealand Tsunami Database is not intended to be complete - the comparatively short period of human occupation, very short period of written records ( < 200 years), and sparse population impedes any such attempt. The database is subject to change as new information arises about old events and new interpretations are developed. Modern tsunamis will also be added to the database.
